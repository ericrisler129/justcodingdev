I wasn’t sure whether CMS had addressed this yet, so I went to my Draft <em>ICD-10-CM Manual</em>, Chapter 15: Pregnancy, Childbirth, and the Puerperium and was pleasantly surprised to discover that the Draft <em>ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting</em> had indeed addressed this topic. It appears the answer to the question is no, they won’t be able to calculate the trimester based on the EDC.\r\n\r\nThe Draft <em>ICD-10-CM Official Coding Guidelines for Coding and Reporting</em> state:\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Assignment of the final character for trimester should be based on the provider’s documentation of the trimester (or number of weeks) for the current admission/encounter. This applies to the assignment of trimester for pre-existing conditions as well as those that develop during or are due to the pregnancy. The provider’s documentation of the number of weeks may be used to assign the appropriate code identifying the trimester.</em></p>\r\nUnfortunately, the guidelines do not address the ability of the coder to calculate the trimester based on the EDC.\r\n\r\nThis does not surprise me as this seems to follow current ICD-9-CM  guidelines on documentation when it comes to coders and calculations. For example, coders are not allowed to calculate the body mass index. The provider or the dietician/nursing notes must supply that documentation.\r\n\r\nAlthough some may not agree with the guidelines for the various documentation nightmares we see, I for one appreciate the definition between coder vs. physician. After all, it is the physician’s responsibility to ensure that his or her documentation is legible, complete, clear, consistent, and precise, as well as accurate and reliable. The documentation should include the history, present illness, course of treatment, outcome of all tests, procedures, and treatments, and  be specific enough in terms of anatomical sites and etiologies of symptoms to support the assigned codes.\r\n\r\nAnd when it comes to the various antepartum complications, some conditions occur only in certain trimesters, and therefore it is important that the physician identify the specificity for proper code assignment.',

		'body' : 'While working within the ICD-10-PCS system, one question keeps coming to mind: Does the physician have to document that a procedure was diagnostic?\r\n\r\nOne of the unique opportunities we have with ICD-10-PCS codes is the ability for specificity. The qualifier character for certain root operations can be either X (indicating diagnostic) or Z (no qualifier).\r\n\r\nFrom an educational perspective, when I write coding questions I always try to take as much subjectivity as possible out of the questions. But as we all know, in the real world we don’t always have that option based on physician documentation practices. So, although I can write a question and say that the procedure was performed diagnostically, coders in their day-to-day don’t always encounter documentation that is clear as to whether a procedure was performed for a diagnostic purpose or otherwise.\r\n\r\nSo, let\'s first consider, how likely are we to see physician document that a procedure was performed diagnostically? Looking back at some of my coding experiences over the year, I can only think of a handful of times when a physician identified that he or she was performing a procedure for a diagnostic purpose. If physicians are not aware that documentation is required for us to code the qualifier for diagnostic, how likely are we to get the documentation? And even if we bring it to their attention, how many will be willing to continually identify whether a procedure is diagnostic?\r\n\r\nSecond, let\'s examine whether documentation that the procedure was performed diagnostically is required or whether we are allowed to assume that certain procedures are always diagnostic. For example, if a physician performs an excisional biopsy on a breast mass, can we assume that it was diagnostic? And if so, then why do we have \"Z\" (no qualifier) as an option if the procedure would always be considered diagnostic. This leads me to believe that documentation by the physician is required. I have searched the current ICD-10-PCS guidelines and I have not found any guidance on the matter.\r\n\r\nShouldn\'t the ICD-10-PCS guidelines address this? And if the guidelines don\'t, then shouldn\'t we ask for clarification, or will we see a disconnect in terms of how the qualifier value is used based on each coder\'s interpretation? Personally, I prefer something in writing from the powers that be as to how to utilize the qualifier values. Physicians are more likely to change their documentation practices based on something in writing vs. just a coder\'s word. Thoughts?',

Currently, we have very limited guidance when it comes to procedural coding using ICD-9-CM volume 3 codes, and most of that guidance comes from the American Hospital Association\'s (AHA) <em>Coding Clinics,</em> <a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/2011/12/aha-discusses-coding-clinic-plans/\">which we have to remember are going away once ICD-10-CM/PCS takes effect in 2013</a>. The AHA will issue new <em>Coding Clinics</em> as question arise.\r\n\r\nOne area that caught my attention is one that we all have memorized as coders. Currently in ICD-9 or in our outpatient world, if we begin a procedure laparoscopic and convert to open, we only code the open procedure. They even developed code V64.41 (laparoscopic surgical procedure converted to open procedure) to identify this and to use as an additional diagnosis because we only report the open procedure code.\r\n\r\nHowever, when we move to ICD-10-PCS, there is a multiple procedure guideline that states we should code multiple procedures when the intended root operation is attempted using <em>one</em> approach but is converted to a <em>different</em> approach. For example, consider a laparoscopic cholecystectomy that is converted to an open cholecystectomy. You would report this as both a percutaneous endoscopic inspection <em>and</em> an open resection. However, the CPT rule still applies for the physician’s coding, so there will be a disconnect between what the facility reports and what the surgeon reports.\r\n\r\nAnother area where we see this is when it comes to coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) procedures. Currently, harvesting the saphenous vein is included in the procedure for the CABG and is not reported separately. When we move to ICD-10-PCS, we have a coding guideline that states if a physician obtains an autograft from a different body part to complete the objective of the procedures, a separate procedure is coded. The example they use is a CABG with an excision of the saphenous vein to use as the graft. You would report separately the excision of the saphenous vein along with the CABG procedure. However, our physician world will still follow CPT guidelines, which state that the excision to obtain the graft is included and therefore <em>not</em> reported separately.\r\n\r\nSo I\'m wondering why is there such a disconnect between how we code now with ICD-9-CM volume 3 codes? And why is there going to be a disconnect between how physicians will report a particular procedure vs. how facilities will report that same procedure in ICD-10-PCS?\r\n\r\nThe only explanation I can offer is that facilities and physicians don’t actually have the same work ‘value’ when a procedure is performed. While the physician’s revenue is tied to his or her actual work, the facility has equipment and staffing, for example,that is involved when those procedures are performed, and that may be the rationale for the changes in the guidelines. But without actually hearing it from the powers that make these decisions, we can only speculate about the reasons behind the changes. It sure would be nice if when they change a particular code or guideline, they would also give us the rationale behind the changes like we get from the American Medical Association when there is a change to CPT—don’t you agree?',

What a headache, huh?\r\n\r\nAll payers were required to be ANSI X12 Version 5010 compliant by January 1, 2012, which is a separate issue from having to have their claims processing systems ready for ICD-10-CM/PCS coding by the October 1, 2013, implementation date. Hopefully most payers will be on board, but the possibility remains that some payers may not implement ICD-10-CM/PCS until after October 1, 2013.\r\n\r\nFor starters, you might want to check in with your state Medicaid program to see what their plans are. Some have suggested that payers may choose to delay implementation of ICD-10 as a strategy for saving reprogramming costs of their claims processing system. That seems shortsighted. After all, it would just be a delay, not a total savings.\r\n\r\nOthers have suggested that while all payers have to accept ICD-10 codes on October 1, 2013, there will be different degrees of readiness on some payers’ parts. For example, a state Medicaid plan may have to “patch” their own system in order to accept the ICD-10 code from the provider and then translate it to an ICD-9 code that their system can still understand. The intent is that it should be transparent to the provider. Sounds like trouble to me though!\r\n\r\nAnd because it is always best and most efficient to pay the claim correctly the first time, wouldn’t a delay be more expensive in the long run? Payers and providers would have to deal with additional costs of data translation, inappropriate denials, reviews, appeals, resubmissions, etc. That equates to more administrative expenses rather than any type of savings.\r\n\r\nHopefully all payers will be on board at the drop dead date and will not have to MacGyver their system so that they can translate ICD-10 codes back to ICD-9. Doing so, even for a transitional period, is bound to create havoc.',

This means coders should use a sixth code for pins, rods, plates, prosthesis, and the like. It does not include a temporary catheter. If it’s removed, it’s not considered a device in terms of ICD-10-PCS.\r\n\r\nReport the device with the appropriate sixth character. For the external replacement of the right breast using an autologous tissue substitute, report code 0HRTX7Z.

For a nonautologous skin substitute, report K as the sixth character (0HRTXKZ).\r\n\r\nMaterials such as sutures, ligatures, radiological markers, and temporary post-operative wound drains are integral to a procedure, so don’t code those as devices either.\r\n\r\nSome codes will not even offer a device option.

If we cannot compare apples to apples when managing diseases and treatments, how will we improve patient care as well as compete with the world?\r\n\r\nAs it stands, we are out of ICD-9 codes and can no longer accurately report patients’ diagnoses as well as treatments and emerging technologies. Without accurate diagnosis and procedure codes, our payment systems are restricted and cannot be designed to pay providers appropriately.\r\n\r\nFrom the standpoint of creating significant burdens, physician practices have to implement ICD-10-CM, not ICD-10-PCS like many hospitals across the country. Hospitals that are paid under the prospective payment system will be directly impacted by changing to ICD-10-PCS, but physicians will not—they will continue to be paid under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule with ICD-10-CM, potentially only impacting coverage determinations because CPT-4 is the basis of their reimbursement structure. DRG payments to hospitals will certainly shift—mostly likely in a negative direction—until coding competence using ICD-10-CM/PCS increases. The risk and burden are much greater to hospitals than they are to physician practices when you consider the volume and costs for inpatient care.\r\n\r\nI was very pleased to see that the American Health Information Management Association stepped up and responded to the AMA\'s position with published disappointment.\r\n\r\nWe are less than two years away from flipping the switch to ICD-10-CM/PCS, and both providers and payers have spent hundreds of millions (if not billions) of dollars since 2009 to prepare for this conversion. I read the AHIMA members’ reactions on the <a href=\"http://cop.ahima.org/\">Communities of Practice</a>, and I was relieved to see that the overwhelming majority of members were equally disappointed and brought forward some excellent counterpoints and insight.',

		'body' : 'Outpatient coders are getting very familiar with combination codes when it comes to procedure coding, thanks to the AMA. Coders have been seeing more and more combined procedures in recent years in the <em>CPT<em><sup>®</sup></em> Manual</em>. For example, in 2011, AMA combined CT of the abdomen and CT of the pelvis into a single code. So the thought of combination codes for diagnoses shouldn’t be that scary.\r\n\r\nSome of the combinations will make life easier. In ICD-10-CM, coders will only need one code to report type 2 diabetes mellitus with mild nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy with macular edema instead of three in ICD-9-CM. The single ICD-10-CM code includes the type of diabetes mellitus, the body system affected, and the specific complications affecting that body system.\r\n\r\nSome of the combinations may come as a surprise, though. Codes in categories T36–T65 are combination codes that include substances related to adverse effects, poisonings, toxic effects and underdosing, and external causes (e.g., T39.011A, poisoning by aspirin, accidental [unintentional], initial encounter).\r\n\r\nCombination external cause codes identify sequential events that result in an injury, such as a fall that results in striking an object (e.g., W01.111A, fall on same level from slipping, tripping, and stumbling with subsequent striking against power tool or machine, initial encounter).\r\n\r\nStart now by reviewing some of the categories with combination codes: diabetes, coronary artery disease, pressure ulcers, and poisonings and adverse effects. Review the documentation you currently have and try coding the record in both ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM. That will help you determine what’s missing, then share that information with physicians.\r\n\r\nYou can even start querying them for the additional information now. Hopefully, they will be in the habit of documenting the additional information by the time October 1, 2013 rolls around.',

Well, you won’t find eponyms—words derived from the name of a real, fictional, mythical, or spurious character or person—in ICD-10-PCS. So you’ll need to know what that physician is actually doing.\r\n\r\nFor example, when a physician documents he or she performed a Whipple procedure (and the physicians will still use that term), you will need to know the physician performed a pancreaticoduodenectomy. (Yeah, Whipple procedure is much easier to remember and say.)\r\n\r\nSimilarly, an Abbott-Fisher-Lucas procedure is a two-stage technique for hip fusion in absence of femoral head, failed femoral prosthesis, or infected trochanteric mold arthroplasty. If you work for an OB/GYN, you’ve probably also seen documentation of Smead-Jones technique, a running closure technique used to approximate abdominal fascia, rectus muscles, and anterior peritoneum.\r\n\r\nPhysicians will not be required to change their terminology for documenting procedures in ICD-10-PCS (lucky for them, but not so much for us). So how do you know what the physician means by Gatellier-Chastang approach? The best way to know is to ask now.\r\n\r\nLook at your documentation and see what eponyms your physicians currently use. Make a list, then make an appointment to sit down with the physicians and have them explain exactly what they are doing for each procedure.

For example, in ICD-9-CM, if a physician documents osteoplasty of the facial bone without specifying which facial bone, coders can report 76.69 (other facial bone repair).\r\n\r\nHowever, in ICD-10-PCS, the coder will need to know the actual bone or bones the physician repaired in order to select the appropriate code. A repair of the facial bone codes to 0NQ, but the fourth character, body part, offers 29 possible choices. In addition to the specific bone, coders will also need to know which side of the face is involved. The code for an open repair of the left temporal bone (0NQ60ZZ) differs from the code for an open repair of the right temporal bone (0NQ50ZZ).\r\n\r\nThat can sound a little daunting at first, but remember that most of this information is already somewhere in the medical record. Physicians know which bone or bones they repaired, but you might need to search for the documentation.\r\n\r\nReach out to your physicians now to get them in the habit of documenting this information in a certain place. You might have more luck asking them where they usually document it so you’ll know where to look. And if it’s already in the documentation, that’s one less thing you will need to ask about later.',

Queries are technically not limited just to inpatient coding and in some cases can also be done for outpatient or professional services. For the moment, I’d like to focus more on the previous than the latter.\r\n\r\nCurrently, queries can be performed concurrently or retrospectively to the inpatient admission/discharge. Concurrent queries, which are generally preferred, are posed while the patient is still “in-house” and the physician is readily available to provide clarification while the information is new in his or her mind. Verbal queries are generally included with the concurrent queries. Retrospective queries are performed after the patient is discharged, typically prior to the billing or post-billing. The query responsibility is generally shared by the coding staff as well as clinical documentation improvement (CDI) staff members.\r\n\r\nNow on to why I am bringing this up.\r\n\r\nQueries performed by CDI specialists traditionally have been mostly limited to diagnoses (and in many cases ones that affect the overall reimbursement), such as complications/comorbidities (CCs and MCCs). But some of these queries have no financial bearing on the case and are simply posed to obtain added specificity to reflect true severity of illness.\r\n\r\nWe know that with all the added details in the ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes, there very well may be many more opportunities for queries to be posed. But, my cause for concern is that the ICD-10-PCS codes will require a very thorough understanding of how physicians actually perform the procedures and the anatomy involved, which may go beyond the clinical knowledge of coder.\r\n\r\nSo, will CDI specialists become more involved in the query process as it relates to procedure coding? Procedures can certainly have an impact on the overall MS-DRG assigned, and incorrect assignment can lead to improper overpayments (or underpayments). If a question arises regarding a procedure, would it make more sense for the coder or the CDI specialist to pose it to the surgeon? CDIs are in many cases spread very thin (as coders are as well) and may even find it hard to even touch all the cases more than once or twice from a diagnosis standpoint.\r\n\r\nSo will it present problems in the future if we add to their workload additional clarifications needed for operative reports? All seven characters must be assigned to qualify as a complete ICD-10-PCS code, so there is no way out by using a vague code with digits/characters identifying “unspecified.”',

		'body' : 'Some of the ICD-10-PCS root operations are very similar—think excision (cutting out or off, without replacement, a portion of a body part) and resection (cutting out or off, without replacement, all of a body part). So how is a coder supposed to choose? Physicians will tell us by which root operation they document, right?\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, wrong. According to the <em>Official Guidelines for ICD-10-PCS</em> (A11), the physician does not have to document a specific root operation. Many of the terms used to construct PCS codes are defined within the system. Physicians are not expected to use the terms used in ICD-10-PCS code descriptions and coders don’t need to query the physician when the documentation clearly matches the defined PCS terms. The coder is responsible to determine what the documentation in the medical record equates to in the PCS definitions.\r\n\r\nEven so, ICD-10-PCS relies solely upon written provider description of the procedure. If the physician documents left upper lung lobectomy, coders would report a resection of upper lung lobe, left, not an excision.\r\n\r\nRaise your hand if you have even seen a physician document extirpation. Anyone? Well, we know physicians take or cut out solid matter from a body part. They just don’t say they extirpated the kidney stone. They might document removal or extraction. Coders will have to read the operative report to see what the physician actually performed in order to choose the correct root operation.\r\n\r\nStart looking at the most common procedures physicians perform at your facility, then compare the documentation to the root operations and see if you can pick the correct one. Not sure about a procedure? Ask a physician to explain exactly what’s going on.\r\n\r\nNot every coder can just walk up to a physician and ask questions. (Wouldn’t life be easier if they could?) If you are in that situation, talk to your manager or supervisor. Ask if they would set up short training sessions where different physicians explain procedures within their area of expertise.

Some of them are funny (I’m talking to you, W61.43, pecked by turkey) and others are so strange that most coders will probably never use them (V95.42, forced landing of spacecraft injuring occupant).\r\n\r\nThe added specificity isn’t just for laughs. For example, if a patient comes in with the bends (also known as decompression sickness), physicians need to know where that patient took ill –underwater, underground, in an airplane making a rapid descent—to properly treat the patient and to get a better idea of how sick the patient might be.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, you might not think it matters whether a patient is exposed to a bed fire due to unspecified burning material (X08.00), due to a burning cigarette (X08.01), or due to other burning material (X08.09). However, if a burning cigarette caused the fire, your patient might be a smoker and may have other, smoking-related conditions. Alternately, the fire may have been started by a disgruntled partner tired of your patient’s snoring. So it could be attempted murder. It could also be the result of  a person with dementia falling asleep with a lit cigarette.\r\n\r\nDoes it matter where the patient was exposed to fire? ICD-10-CM thinks so. One series of codes denotes bed fire, another a sofa fire, and a third other furniture fire. So what, you ask? Consider that furniture can be made from different materials and some of those may release toxic fumes when they burn.\r\n\r\nFor treatment purposes, the physician needs to know what burned. For payment purposes, coders need to report the most specific code. Doing so will help you justify using more resources for a patient exposed to toxic fumes during a fire.\r\n\r\nAlso keep in mind that these causes of injury codes aren’t appearing alone on the claim. So while they might seem silly in isolation, they really are telling a better story about why the patient came in for treatment.',

Is it allergic, irritant, or unspecified contact dermatitis?\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>L23.7, Allergic contact dermatitis due to plants, except food</li>\r\n	<li>L24.7, Irritant contact dermatitis due to plants, except food</li>\r\n	<li>L25.5, Unspecified contact dermatitis due to plants, except food</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nEven though ICD-10-CM contains an unspecified code, avoid using it as much as possible. One reason for the switch to ICD-10-CM is to increase specificity and using an unspecified code defeats the purpose.\r\n\r\nMoving on from Bobby, we run into three members of an Irish step dancing troupe who presented to the clinic together. Apparently someone went the wrong way on stage and caused a pile up.\r\n\r\nMegan suffered a sprained right ankle during the collision. That should be easy to code since we know which side and which joint, right? Wait, we don’t know which ligament. That’s a problem because we have four codes to choose from.\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S93.401, Sprain of unspecified ligament of right ankle</li>\r\n	<li>S93.411, Sprain of calcaneofibular ligament of right ankle</li>\r\n	<li>S93.431, Sprain of tibiofibular ligament of right ankle</li>\r\n	<li>S93.491, Sprain of other ligament of right ankle (internal collateral ligament or talofibular ligament)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nHmm, we have an unspecified code, but we already decided to avoid those as much as possible. So instead let’s take a good look at the medical record and see if  one of the practitioners documented which ligament somewhere.\r\n\r\nBingo. After some serious sleuthing, we find a notation from Dr. O\'Malley of tibiofibular ligament sprain. So we’re almost all set. Why almost, you ask? We need a seventh character for S93.431. In our review of the record we also find that this is Megan’s first visit for this sprain, so we would add a seventh character A to get S93.431A as our code.\r\n\r\nOur second step dancer Bridget suffered some bumps and bruises as well as a possible concussion. So let’s first look for the sites of the contusions. Dr. O’Malley documents multiple contusions of the front wall of the thorax, upper arm, elbow, and wrist. That leaves us with lots of possibilities, depending on which side of the body is involved.\r\n\r\nFortunately, Dr. O’Malley documented that all of Bridget’s injuries are on her left side and this is an initial visit, so we can report:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S20.212A, Contusion of left front wall of thorax</li>\r\n	<li>S40.022A, Contusion of left upper arm</li>\r\n	<li>S50.02xA, Contusion of left elbow</li>\r\n	<li>S60.212A, Contusion of left wrist</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWhat about the possible concussion? In the outpatient world, we can’t code it. The <em>2012 ICD-10-CM Coding Guidelines</em>, Section IV Diagnostic Coding and Reporting Guidelines for Outpatient Services, state:\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Do not code diagnoses documented as “probable”, “suspected,” “questionable,” “rule out,” or “working diagnosis” or other similar terms indicating uncertainty. Rather, code the condition(s) to the highest degree of certainty for that encounter/visit, such as symptoms, signs, abnormal test results, or other reason for the visit.</em></p>\r\nIf Bridget was admitted as an inpatient, we could code the possible concussion, but because she’s treated as an outpatient in the clinic, we can’t.\r\n\r\nOur final dancer Declan got the worst of that collision. He came in with a broken arm in addition to some contusions and a dislocated wrist. He also received a puncture wound to his hand.\r\n\r\nDr. O’Malley documents an initial visit for contusions to the right thigh (S70.11xA), right hip (S70.01), and lower right leg (S80.11xA). So far, so good.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to Declan’s broken arm, we need to know which arm, which bone, and what type of fracture. In Dr. O’Malley’s notes, he states Declan suffered a Barton\'s fracture of the left radius, so we would code S52.562A.\r\n\r\nSo now on to Declan’s dislocated wrist. We need to know which wrist and which bone. Again, we find the information in Dr. O’Malley’s notes (Don’t you wish every physician documented this well?). Declan suffered a dislocation of midcarpal joint of left wrist (S63.035A) and a dislocation of distal radioulnar joint of left wrist (S63.015A).\r\n\r\nThat leaves Declan’s puncture wound to the hand. Which hand? Dr. O’Malley documented the left hand and noted that no foreign body remained in the wound. That takes us to S61.432A (puncture wound without foreign body of left hand).\r\n\r\nWell, I for one am happy to see the back of St. Patrick’s Day for another year. It really is a dangerous holiday and we didn’t even get to the leprechauns!',

Meanwhile, the Medical Group Management Association (MGMA) wants HHS to “consider modifying the implementation process to focus on conducting the due diligence necessary for a potential change of this magnitude.”\r\n\r\nHealthcare organizations have already invested a considerable amount of time and resources to preparing for ICD-10-CM/PCS implementation, according to AHIMA’s letter. Because of this investment, AHIMA states its members are critical of HHS’ plan to possibly delay implementation.\r\n\r\nAHIMA calls the updated classification system “essential” for improving healthcare in the United States and fears that those trying to stop ICD-10-CM/PCS implementation don’t understand the classification systems and how they are used.\r\n\r\nDiscussions of a possible delay send the wrong message to healthcare providers, AHIMA says, and it urges HHS to move forward with the October 1, 2013 implementation date.\r\n\r\nMGMA, however, believes HHS needs to create a revised implementation plans before moving forward with ICD-10-CM/PCS. In <a href=\"http://www.mgma.com/WorkArea/mgma_downloadasset.aspx?id=1370049\">its March 1 letter</a>, MGMA outlined seven steps it believes HHS must complete before implementing ICD-10-CM/PCS, including:\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Complete a comprehensive cost benefit analysis</li>\r\n	<li>Pilot test ICD-10</li>\r\n	<li>Analyze the administrative and financial impact of overlapping initiatives</li>\r\n	<li>Evaluate additional code set approaches</li>\r\n	<li>Stagger implementation dates</li>\r\n	<li>Develop appropriate crosswalks</li>\r\n	<li>Require certification</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nMGMA also points out that the healthcare industry is currently struggling to implement HIPAA 5010, adding “it is clear that migration to ICD-10 will be even more complex and costly.”',

All of the more than 50 people surveyed are senior healthcare professionals actively involved in their organization’s ICD-10 transition and carry significant responsibility for the overall success of the project.\r\n\r\nThe study also found:\r\n•    64% of respondents state a delay will not improve readiness\r\n•    60% believe even a one-year delay will have a negative impact\r\n•    69% say a two-year delay would be either potentially catastrophic or unrecoverable\r\n•    76% believe a delay will harm other healthcare reform efforts\r\n\r\nIn addition, the annual cost of delaying the ICD-10 deadline could exceed $4 billion, based on a 30% increase in costs for every year of delay, according to the report.\r\n\r\nThe Workgroup for Electronic Data Interchange (WEDI) submitted the<a href=\"http://wedi.org/cmsUploads/pdfUpload/commentLetters/pub/WEDI_ICD-10_Progress_Survey_Final_%5b03-16-2012%5d.pdf\"> results of its most recent ICD-10 survey</a> to CMS. Since 2009, WEDI has conducted ICD-10 readiness surveys to measure the progress of industry compliance. It completed its most recent survey in February.\r\n\r\nAccording to the survey, approximately half of healthcare organizations don’t know when they will complete their ICD-10-CM/PCS impact assessment to prepare for the ICD-10 transition.\r\n\r\nIn addition, one-half of those surveys responded that they did not know when external testing would occur and most health plans do not expect to begin external testing until 2013.\r\n\r\nPossibly of more concern is the state of vendor readiness. CMS has already delayed enforcement of HIPAA 5010 twice because vendors weren’t ready. Approximately half of the vendors WEDI surveyed are less than halfway complete with product development.\r\n\r\nApproximately 2,600 respondents (2,118 providers, 231 vendors, and 242 health plans) took part in WEDI’s survey.',

		'body' : 'Spring is in the air and Anytown just held its combined Spring Festival and Easter egg hunt. I’m sad to say things did not go smoothly, judging by the number of patients in the Fix ‘Em Up outpatient clinic.\r\n\r\nDave tried to steal a march on the competition by snagging some real goose eggs. Momma goose wasn’t very happy about that and took a few bites out of Dave. So where did the goose bite Dave? In Dave’s chart, Dr. Bunny notes superficial bites on his left arm, left leg, and, right buttocks. She also notes she is seeing Dave for the first time for these injuries.\r\n\r\nBefore we can code these injuries, we need some additional information. Let’s start with the bite to the left arm. Is it on the upper arm, elbow, or forearm? For the leg, did mother goose get Dave’s hip, thigh, knee, or lower leg?\r\n\r\nAfter double-checking Dr. Bunny’s notes, we find the information we need to code these injuries:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S50.872A, other superficial bite of left forearm</li>\r\n	<li>S80.872A, other superficial bite, left lower leg</li>\r\n	<li>S30.870A, other superficial bite of lower back and pelvis</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe chose other superficial bite for all three codes because Dave was not bitten by an insect. ICD-10-CM does contain codes for nonvenomous insect bites, but doesn’t have individual codes for goose bites. So we would need to add one more code to Dave’s list: W61.51XA, bitten by goose.\r\n\r\nOur next two patients, Kelly and Penny, got into a tug of war over a chocolate rabbit they both claim they saw first. Kelly fell and scraped her right knee and bruised her right elbow. In addition, she received a black eye—the left eye, as it happens. Apparently Penny really wanted that chocolate rabbit.\r\n\r\nSo, since this is Kelly’s first visit for these injuries, we would code:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S80.211A, abrasion, right knee</li>\r\n	<li>S50.01XA, contusion of right elbow</li>\r\n	<li>S00.12XA, contusion of left eyelid and periocular area</li>\r\n	<li>Y04.0XXA, assault by unarmed brawl or fight</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nPenny fared much better. She ended up with a bruised left hand -- S60.222A, contusion of left hand – in addition to the coveted chocolate rabbit.\r\n\r\nThe poor chocolate rabbit fared worst of all—Penny ate the entire thing, but suffered no ill effects.\r\n\r\nNot all of the injuries from the festival resulted from the egg hunt. Ted, a 50-year-old man, came in with a bump on the back of his head. He fainted at the sight of blood on Kelly’s right knee. Dr. Bunny documents hematoma of the scalp and vasovagal attack. So we would code:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S00.03XA, contusion of scalp</li>\r\n	<li>R55, syncope and collapse, which includes vasovagal attack</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nOur final patient for the day is Ted’s son Tom. Apparently someone brought a cat to the park, which set off Tom’s feline allergies and led to some serious sneezing. So we would code: J30.81, allergic rhinitis due to animal (cat) (dog) hair and dander.\r\n\r\nIf, instead of sneezing, Tom suffered red or sore skin from contact with the cat then we would report L23.81 allergic contact dermatitis due to animal (cat) (dog) dander.\r\n\r\nWe also saw plenty of people for seasonal allergies (J30.1, allergic rhinitis due to pollen) due to the early spring, as well as a few cases of kids with indigestion from too much candy (K30, functional dyspepsia).\r\n\r\nAnd with that, we can close the charts on another dangerous holiday festival.',

		'body' : 'Several years ago, a pharmaceutical company came under fire because its sales reps were pushing the company’s drugs using Tigger and Eeyore, two popular characters from the \"Winnie the Pooh\" series.  Why Tigger and Eeyore, you ask?\r\n\r\nAnyone who watched The Tigger Movie saw Tigger at his bipolar best. One minute he’s happy and bouncy, and then he’s down in the dumps and dragging his tail. In most Winnie the Pooh cartoons, Tigger demonstrates the intense, “wired” energy and grandiose self-esteem associated with mania. Drug reps left stuffed Tigger toys as a way to promote a bipolar treatment.\r\n\r\nEeyore, meanwhile, is the saddest guy in the Hundred Acre Wood. He’s typically self-loathing, lethargic, and full of hopelessness for the future. That made him the poster critter for depression.\r\n\r\nIf we look at Tigger, Eeyore, and the other residents of the Wood, how would we code for their mental health conditions in ICD-10-CM?\r\n\r\nLet’s start with Tigger. The first thing we need to know is whether he is in a manic phase or a depressive phase. We also need to know if he is displaying psychotic features. Some of the code choices for bipolar disorder in ICD-10-CM include:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>F31.10, Bipolar disorder, current episode manic without psychotic features, unspecified</li>\r\n	<li>F31.11, Bipolar disorder, current episode manic without psychotic features, mild</li>\r\n	<li>F31.12, Bipolar disorder, current episode manic without psychotic features, moderate</li>\r\n	<li>F31.13, Bipolar disorder, current episode manic without psychotic features, severe</li>\r\n	<li>F31.30, Bipolar disorder, current episode depressed, mild or moderate severity, unspecified</li>\r\n	<li>F31.31, Bipolar disorder, current episode depressed, mild</li>\r\n	<li>F31.32, Bipolar disorder, current episode depressed, moderate</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese represent only a fraction of the codes available for bipolar disorder in ICD-10-CM. We really need our physicians to document a lot of information.\r\n\r\nYou should also note that the F31- series includes three Excludes1 notes, which means that the code excluded should never be reported with the code above the Excludes1 note. An Excludes1 is used to indicate when two conditions cannot occur together. Those three conditions are:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Bipolar disorder, single manic episode (F30.-)</li>\r\n	<li>Major depressive disorder, single episode (F32.-)</li>\r\n	<li>Major depressive disorder, recurrent (F33.-)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nLet’s look at Eeyore, who has such a gloomy outlook and rarely talks to anyone. Given his long-standing history of depression, we will probably code for recurrent major depressive disorder. Be careful not to assume. Send a query if the physician doesn’t document single episode or recurrent.\r\n\r\nFor recurrent major depressive disorder, you will choose from these codes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>F33.0, Major depressive disorder, recurrent, mild</li>\r\n	<li>F33.1, Major depressive disorder, recurrent, moderate</li>\r\n	<li>F33.2, Major depressive disorder, recurrent severe without psychotic features</li>\r\n	<li>F33.3, Major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe with psychotic symptoms</li>\r\n	<li>F33.4, Major depressive disorder, recurrent, in remission</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIf this Eeyore’s first episode of depression, look to the F32- series.\r\n\r\nWhat other mental health problems lurk in The Hundred Acre Wood? Our little friend Piglet suffers from some severe anxiety that seems tied to life in general and not a specific phobia. We’re probably looking at generalized anxiety disorder (F41.1) and we need the physician to document that before we can code it.\r\n\r\nIf the physician documents phobic anxiety disorders, we will look to series F40- for the correct ICD-10-CM code. Hopefully physician also documents the specific type of phobia, such as:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>F40.02, Agoraphobia without panic disorder</li>\r\n	<li>F40.210, Arachnophobia</li>\r\n	<li>F40.231, Fear of injections and transfusions</li>\r\n	<li>F40.242, Fear of bridges</li>\r\n	<li>F40.243, Fear of flying</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWinnie the Pooh isn\'t exempt from the mental health problems in The Hundred Acre Wood. Pooh shows signs of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), according to our physician’s notes. The question is, which type?\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>F90.0, Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, predominantly inattentive type</li>\r\n	<li>F90.1, Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, predominantly hyperactive type</li>\r\n	<li>F90.2, Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, combined type</li>\r\n	<li>F90.8, Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, other type</li>\r\n	<li>F90.9 Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, unspecified type</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nPooh may also suffer from obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), as demonstrated by his repetitive counting and fixation on honey. An even better example of OCD is everyone’s favorite gardener, Rabbit. Poor Rabbit, someone is always destroying his hard work in the garden or moving things around in his house.\r\n\r\nWe only have one code for OCD—F42 (obsessive-compulsive disorder), but we do need to note some Excludes2 notes. An Excludes2 note means that the condition excluded is not part of the condition under which it is listed, but a patient may have both conditions at the same time. When an Excludes2 note appears under a code, coders can report both the code and the excluded code together.\r\n\r\nIn addition to OCD, Rabbit may also suffer from obsessive-compulsive personality (disorder) (F60.5) or obsessive-compulsive symptoms occurring in depression (F32-F33) or schizophrenia (F20.-). Again, we need to review the documentation to determine the correct code(s).\r\n\r\nOf course, the residents of The Hundred Acre Wood may not have any mental health problems, but their human friend, Christopher Robin may have a big one. Christopher Robin believes the animals in The Hundred Acre Wood are real. Are they real or is Christopher Robin exhibiting signs of schizophrenia? And if he is schizophrenic, what type of schizophrenia does he have?\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>F20.0, Paranoid schizophrenia</li>\r\n	<li>F20.1, Disorganized schizophrenia</li>\r\n	<li>F20.2, Catatonic schizophrenia</li>\r\n	<li>F20.3, Undifferentiated schizophrenia</li>\r\n	<li>F20.5, Residual schizophrenia</li>\r\n	<li>F20.8, Other schizophrenia</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIn order to code it, we’ll need—you guessed it—documentation in Christopher Robin’s medical record. All of this is bumming me out. Who knew The Hundred Acre Wood was such a sad place?',

I wonder what the problem is. Let’s see what it could be and how we would code it in ICD-10-CM.\r\n\r\nI got a new pair of shoes, so maybe the problem is a blister. That should be easy to code, right? When we look up blister in the ICD-9-CM alphabetic index, it tells us to look up injury, superficial, by site. Couldn’t they just list it under blister?\r\n\r\nWhen we head to foot, we find only two codes for blisters of the feet and toes–blister without mention of infection (917.2) and blister, infected (917.3).\r\n\r\nWhen we look in the ICD-10-CM alphabetic index, we actually find a whole list of possibilities under the term \'blister\'. Okay, so that’s easier. When we find foot, we get code S90.82-. Don’t forget that the dash means we need more characters. A note in the index also tells us not to use this code for blisters of the toes. They have their own set of codes.\r\n\r\nSo off we go to the S90.82- series where we find only three choices:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S90.821, blister (nonthermal), right foot</li>\r\n	<li>S90.822, blister (nonthermal), left foot</li>\r\n	<li>S90.829, blister (nonthermal), unspecified foot</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nHowever, unlike ICD-9-CM, ICD-10-CM includes separate codes for a blister on the toe:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S90.421, blister (nonthermal), right great toe</li>\r\n	<li>S90.422, blister (nonthermal), left great toe</li>\r\n	<li>S90.423, blister (nonthermal), unspecified great toe</li>\r\n	<li>S90.424, blister (nonthermal), right lesser toe(s)</li>\r\n	<li>S90.425, blister (nonthermal), left lesser toe(s)</li>\r\n	<li>S90.426, blister (nonthermal), unspecified lesser toe(s)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe need a seventh character for all of the blister codes to indicate the encounter, so that will expand our possible code choices. Notice that the ICD-10-CM codes include laterality, but no notation of infection. ICD-10-CM also specifies that the blisters are nonthermal, meaning the blister was not caused by heat.\r\n\r\nIf it’s not a blister, what else could it be?  Maybe I fractured a toe. Every time I drop something, it seems to land on my toes. In ICD-9-CM, we can choose between a closed toe fracture (826.0) and an open toe fracture (826.1). Since nothing is sticking out and the skin isn’t broken, I’m going with closed toe fracture.\r\n\r\nWhen we get to ICD-10-CM, the coding gets a lot more complicated. We need to know which toe was fractured. Was it the great toe or a lesser toe? The great toe has its own codes, while the lesser toes are all lumped together. That seems kind of unfair, doesn’t it?\r\n\r\nOnce we know which toe, we need to know which side, whether the fracture is displaced or nondisplaced, and whether the break is on the distal or proximal phalanx. Here’s hoping that physician documents thoroughly.\r\n\r\nFor example, if the physician documents an initial visit for a displaced fracture of the proximal phalanx of the left great toe, we would code S92.412A. As with all fracture codes, we need that seventh character to indicate the episode of care.\r\n\r\nMaybe the problem isn’t with my foot, but with my ankle. It could be bursitis. ICD-9-CM includes only one option—726.79 (enthesopthy of ankle and tarsus, other).\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM, not surprisingly, offers more choices for bursitis of the ankle, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>M06.271, rheumatoid bursitis, right ankle and foot</li>\r\n	<li>M06.272, rheumatoid bursitis, left ankle and foot</li>\r\n	<li>M06.279, rheumatoid bursitis, unspecified ankle and foot</li>\r\n	<li>M10.071, idiopathic gout (also known as gouty bursitis), right ankle and foot</li>\r\n	<li>M10.072, idiopathic gout, left ankle and foot</li>\r\n	<li>M10.079, idiopathic gout, unspecified ankle and foot</li>\r\n	<li>M70.871, other soft tissue disorders related to use, overuse and pressure, right ankle and foot</li>\r\n	<li>M70.872, other soft tissue disorders related to use, overuse and pressure, left ankle and foot</li>\r\n	<li>M70.879, other soft tissue disorders related to use, overuse and pressure, unspecified ankle and foot</li>\r\n	<li>M71.171, other infective bursitis, right ankle and foot</li>\r\n	<li>M71.172, other infective bursitis, left ankle and foot</li>\r\n	<li>M71.179, other infective bursitis, unspecified ankle and foot</li>\r\n	<li>M71.571, other bursitis, not elsewhere classified, right ankle and foot</li>\r\n	<li>M71.572, other bursitis, not elsewhere classified, left ankle and foot</li>\r\n	<li>M71.579, other bursitis, not elsewhere classified, unspecified ankle and foot</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWow, that’s a lot of choices. I think I’ll let podiatrist figure it out.',

On February 14, HHS announced its intention to revisit the compliance date.\r\n\r\nPart of the concern stems from competing initiatives that healthcare providers need to implement, such as electronic health records and HIPAA 5010. The HIPAA 5010 transition has been so complicated that CMS’ Office of E-Health Standards and Services (OESS) has announced two enforcement delays. (Note that those are only delays in enforcement, not implementation. Healthcare entities had to comply with HIPAA 5010 in January, the OESS just won’t penalize non-compliance until June 30.)\r\n\r\nThe American Medical Association led the charge for the ICD-10-CM/PCS implementation delay. In fact the AMA’s House of Delegates voted to “work vigorously to stop implementation of ICD-10” during the closing session of its semi-annual policy-making meeting November 15, 2011. So they earned a delay, but not a total reprieve.\r\n\r\nThe public, including healthcare organizations, will have 30 days to comment on the proposed rule, “Administrative Simplification: Adoption of a Standard for a Unique Health Plan Identifier; Addition to the National Provider Identifier Requirements; and a Change to the Compliance Date for ICD-10-CM and ICD-10-PCS Medical Data Code Sets” once it is published in the <em>Federal Register</em>.\r\n\r\nThe rule is scheduled to publish in the April 17 edition of the <em>Federal Register</em>.To comment on the proposed rule, visit <em>www.regulations.gov</em>.',

If your physician documents any of these phobias, you would report ICD-10-CM code F40.298 (other specified phobia). So even though the code doesn’t specify the phobia, the documentation does.\r\n\r\nIf the physician documents a generic phobia, but doesn’t say what the patient is specifically afraid of, you would have to default to the unspecified code F40.9 (phobic anxiety disorder, unspecified). Of course before you do that, you should query the physician.

As a result, she hit the ground and suffered some contusions and scrapes to both hands. When we looked through Dr. Rocky’s notes, we found that Melissa suffered:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S60.211A, contusion of right wrist</li>\r\n	<li>S60.222A, contusion of left hand</li>\r\n	<li>S60.412A, abrasion of right middle finger</li>\r\n	<li>S60.414A, abrasion of right ring finger</li>\r\n	<li>S60.416, abrasion of right little finger</li>\r\n	<li>S60.512A, abrasion of left hand</li>\r\n	<li>S60.812A, abrasion of left wrist</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nNotice that all of these codes specify laterality, so if Dr. Rocky didn’t include that information, we would have to query for it. You could choose a code for unspecified hand, wrist, or finger, and you would probably get paid, at least initially. But one of the reasons for moving to ICD-10-CM is to capture the additional detail, and the term “unspecified” is, well, not specific.\r\n\r\nAlso consider this: if Melissa had suffered contusions to the both the right and left hands, you would be able to report both using different codes. So you’d get paid for both without having to appeal a denial for a duplicate code.\r\n\r\nIn addition to Melissa’s abrasions and contusions, we also need to code her run in with the squirrels. So add W53.29xA (other contact with squirrel) to the list.\r\n\r\nMelissa’s husband Chris also found himself on the wrong side of the squirrels. Unfortunately for him, Chris fled in the direction of the park pond, tripped over a log, and fell in. Fortunately he can swim, so he only suffered a slight ankle sprain, a constriction of the leg from some weeds in the pond, and some bruised pride.\r\n\r\nWhen Chris tried to climb out of the pond, he ran afoul of some turtles lurking near shore. The ferocious turtles showed less mercy than the squirrels.\r\n\r\nDr. Rocky noted the following injuries in Chris’ record:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S70.341A, external constriction, right thigh</li>\r\n	<li>S93.421A, sprain of deltoid ligament of right ankle</li>\r\n	<li>S60.475A, other superficial bite of left ring finger</li>\r\n	<li>S60.477A, other superficial bite of left little finger</li>\r\n	<li>S00.37xA, other superficial bite of nose</li>\r\n	<li>S80.872A, other superficial bite, left lower leg</li>\r\n	<li>S90.472A, other superficial bite of left great toe</li>\r\n	<li>S91.154A, open bite of right lesser toe(s) without damage to nail</li>\r\n	<li>S30.0xxA, contusion of lower back and pelvis</li>\r\n	<li>W53.29xA, other contact with squirrel</li>\r\n	<li>W59.21xA, bitten by turtle</li>\r\n	<li>W59.22xA, struck by turtle</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThat’s a long list of codes, but they really do tell a story.

CMS confirmed that the code freeze will hold until ICD-10-CM/PCS is implemented regardless of the delay, according to Pat Brooks, RHIA, senior technical advisor at CMS. Brooks provided the update during the AHIMA ICD-10 Summit April 16 in Baltimore.\r\n\r\nBrooks indicated CMS believed that doing away with the code freeze “would be rather catastrophic,” both for CMS and for providers.\r\n\r\nThis means the next regular code update won’t occur until one year after the eventual implementation of ICD-10-CM/PCS. If HHS finalizes the proposed October 1, 2014 implementation deadline, the next update would be October 1, 2015. The 2013 code updates will only relate to new diseases and technologies.\r\n\r\nBrooks also urged providers to comment on the proposed rule, as the delay to October 1, 2014, has not been finalized. The published rule should appear in the <em>Federal Register</em> April 17. The comment period will extend for 30 days after that date.\r\n\r\nBrooks also said that the quick release of the April 9 proposed rule was a “heroic effort” after Secretary Kathleen Sebelius announced a possible delay in February.',

		'body' : 'A one-year delay in ICD-10-CM/PCS isn’t a slam dunk. “We’re recommending it, but it’s not [guaranteed],” said Denise Buenning, group director CMS Office of E-Health Standards and Services. Buenning delivered CMS ICD-10 Report on State of the Union at the AHIMA ICD-10 Summit April 17 in Baltimore.\r\n\r\n“The absolute worst thing you can do is stop working toward implementation,” Buenning added. “Follow our lead and stay the course.”\r\n\r\nA series of events made CMS consider delaying ICD-10-CM/PCS implementation. One of the largest centered on problems providers and payers experienced when implementing HIPAA Version 5010. Many vendors did not have software updates in place in time to meet the January 1, 2012, implementation date. As a result, CMS has twice delayed the enforcement of HIPAA 5010.\r\n\r\nImplementing HIPAA 5015 was supposed to be the easier transition, so CMS officials became concerned about potential problems with ICD-10-CM/PCS implementation.\r\n\r\nHHS received many unsolicited comments regarding the delay with a number of different recommendations, Buenning said.\r\n\r\nDuring the discussions about a possible delay, many wondered whether CMS might skip ICD-10-CM/PCS completely and move straight to ICD-11. That would result in huge economic losses and might not be feasible given the configuration of ICD-11, Buenning said.\r\n\r\nCMS proposed the one-year delay after much consideration. A delay of longer than two years would be a waste of resources for those who have already spent a lot toward the implementation, Buenning said. A one-year delay balances the industry’s need to know when ICD-10-CM/PCS will be implemented, gives those who need it more time, but doesn’t penalize those who have already begun implementation.\r\n\r\n“Use any additional time to your best advantage,” Buenning said, adding “I’m sure testing will be a big part of that conversation.”\r\n\r\nCMS offered up a 30-day comment period “because we want to put out the final rule as soon as possible,” Buenning said. Normally, CMS provides a comment period of 60 days or more.\r\n\r\n“We take feedback very seriously,\" she said. \"Positive and negative, we need all of it.”\r\n\r\n&nbsp;',

Coyote is back in the Acme ED, this time with a broken arm, leg, pelvis, and ribs. He also dislocated his ankle and suffered a kidney contusion. Apparently, he was too busy watching the Roadrunner scamper away to see that truck coming. And Wile E. was wearing roller skates at the time. Go figure.\r\n\r\nSo let’s start with Wile E.’s fractures. In reviewing Dr. Frankenbean’s notes, we find all of Wile E.’s injuries are on the right side. So that’s one piece of information we can check off. Dr. Frankenbean also notes that this is an initial visit. That’s our second important piece of information.\r\n\r\nNext we need to know if the fractures are open or closed. The seventh character for fractures is different for open and closed fractures. For open fractures, coders need additional detail from the Gustilo-Anderson classifications.\r\n\r\nDr. Frankenbean’s notes don’t say, so we send him a query. Dr. Frankenbean confirms that all of Wile E.’s fractures are closed fractures. That means we can just look at the seventh character for closed fractures and since we know this is an initial visit, we’ll use A.\r\n\r\nNext we need to know which specific bones Wile E. broke. Did he break his radius, ulna, or humerus? Did he only break one bone or multiple bones? Where specifically did the breaks occur—distal, proximal, midshaft?\r\n\r\nWe need the same information for the leg bones. Did Wile E. fracture his femur, tibia, fibula, or a combination, and where did the bones break?\r\n\r\nWe also need to know whether any of the fractures, including the ribs, are displaced.\r\n\r\nAfter sorting through Dr. Frankenbean’s extensive, but rather unorganized notes, we find that Wile E. suffered:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Nondisplaced fracture of greater tuberosity of right humerus (S42.254A)</li>\r\n	<li>Multiple fractures of pelvis with stable disruption of pelvic ring (S32.810A)</li>\r\n	<li>Displaced apophyseal fracture of right femur (S72.131A)</li>\r\n	<li>Displaced fracture of medial condyle of right tibia (S82.131A)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWile E.’s dislocated right ankle is easy enough to code—S93.04xA (dislocation of right ankle joint). So are his broken ribs, as it turns out. We know Wile E. suffered multiple rib fractures, all on the right side, so we would code S22.41xA.\r\n\r\nWhat about his kidney contusion? Dr. Frankenbean documents a 1.5 cm contusion of the right kidney, which leads us to code S37.011A (minor contusion of right kidney).\r\n\r\nWhile sorting through Dr. Frankenbean’s notes, we also find some additional injuries for Wile E., specifically:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S40.011A, contusion of right shoulder</li>\r\n	<li>S40.811A, abrasion of right upper arm</li>\r\n	<li>S44.11xA, injury of median nerve at upper arm level, right arm</li>\r\n	<li>S50.811A, abrasion of right forearm</li>\r\n	<li>S81.011A,laceration without foreign body, right knee</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe also need to code for Wile E.’s run in with the Acme truck, so we would look to category V03, pedestrian injured in collision with car, pick-up truck, or van. Under V03, we find V03.01A (pedestrian on roller-skates injured in collision with car, pick-up truck or van in nontraffic accident), so we would add that to the list.\r\n\r\nPoor Wile E., he’s really been through the ringer with this mishap. But I’m sure he’ll pull through just fine. He’s one tough coyote.',

Most of the codes are longer than the current ICD-9-CM codes, which could increase the chances that you’ll inadvertently switch characters.\r\n\r\nReporting the wrong code can be problematic because sometimes you may transpose a number and still have a valid code. It won’t represent what the physician did, but you’ll still get paid. For example, you might report M12.211 (villonodular synovitis [pigmented], right shoulder). Great- that’s a valid code for a joint disease characterized by inflammation and overgrowth of the joint lining.\r\n\r\nBut what if you actually meant M21.211 (flexion deformity, right shoulder)?  That’s a very different condition.\r\n\r\nOr you might forget the placeholder which means you won’t have a valid code. For example, a patient comes in with burns involving 50-59% of body surface with 30-39% third degree burns. If you report T31.53, you won’t get paid. Why? For codes in the T31, coders must indicate the encounter—initial, subsequent, or sequel.  By now you’ve probably noticed the code is only five characters long. So, maybe you just add the D for a subsequent encounter to make it T31.53D. Unfortunately, you still won’t get paid because the D must be the seventh character. You need to add an X as a placeholder, so the correct code is T31.53XD.\r\n\r\nDon’t panic, just pay attention. Make sure you report the correct characters in the proper place. And don’t forget to read the guidelines and instructional notes.',

Which ICD-10-PCS root operation should be reported?\r\n\r\nIn this case, it’s fairly easy: reposition. In a reposition procedure, the physician moves a body part to a new location, either its normal location or a new location to enhance its ability to function. Since the physician is putting the bone back where it belongs, we would code a reposition. For our right tibia open reduction, we would report code 0QSG0ZZ.\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>0DS64ZZ, laparoscopy with gastropexy for malrotation</li>\r\n	<li>0MSP4ZZ, left knee arthroscopy with reposition of anterior cruciate ligament</li>\r\n	<li>01S40ZZ, open transposition of ulnar nerve</li>\r\n	<li>0QS634Z, closed reduction with percutaneous internal fixation of right femoral neck fracture</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nMost of these codes denote laterality, the exception in this list being the ulnar nerve transposition. So make sure the physician documents which side he or she operated on. Also, be sure to read the entire operative report, not just the summary. Sometimes a physician may title a procedure as an open reduction, when in fact, the physician performed a closed reduction.',

I hope you had a great weekend because it’s time to dive into coding for today’s visitors to the Fix ‘Em Up Clinic.\r\n\r\nOur first patient, nine-year-old Chris, arrived with a really nasty case of chicken pox. Dr. Killdare doesn’t document whether Chris suffered any complications with his chickenpox, so we need to query. Chris could suffer from encephalitis, myelitis, or encephalomyelitis along with his chickenpox (B01.1-) or he could have other complications (B01.8-). Fortunately for Chris, he avoided complications, so we would report code B01.9 (varicella without complication).\r\n\r\nIf you don’t know varicella is the official name of chickenpox, don’t worry. In the ICD-10-CM alphabetic index, under chickenpox, it says, see varicella.\r\n\r\nOur next patient, Nancy, is back for a follow up visit with Dr. Killdare after fracturing her right ulna. When we look up her initial injury, we find that Dr. Killdare treated Nancy for a displaced fracture of olecranon process without intraarticular extension of right ulna (S52.021A) last month. In his documentation for today’s visit, Dr. Killdare notes Nancy’s fracture is not healing correctly.\r\n\r\nSo we still need to know whether it’s delayed healing, nonunion, or malunion. By reading further in Dr. Killdare’s note, we find documentation of malunion, so we would report S52.021P. That’s almost the exact same code we reported during Nancy’s initial visit. The only difference is the seventh character. For her first visit we used ‘A’ for initial, while this visit, we used ‘P’ for malunion.\r\n\r\nIf Dr. Killdare documented delayed healing, we would use ‘G’ for the seventh character. For a nonunion, we would use ‘K’ as the seventh character extension. Keep in mind the majority of the code—those first six characters—don’t change. Anytime Nancy comes in for treatment of that same fracture, we would code S52.021 with the appropriate seventh character.\r\n\r\nBill, an unlucky cave explorer, rounds out our Monday at Fix ‘Em Up.\r\n\r\nA falling rock hit Bill in the back during a cave-in, leaving some nasty bruises. Bill also scrapped both palms. Dr. Killdare documented this as the first encounter. What should we report?\r\n\r\nLet’s start with the bruised back. Where specifically are the bruises—shoulder, neck, lower back, or multiple sites? In his notes, Dr. Killdare documents multiple lower back contusions, which leads us to S30.0xxA (contusion of lower back and pelvis).\r\n\r\nMoving on, we next look at Bill’s scrapped palms. Are they lacerated, bruised, abraded, or all of the above? Also, did Bill injure any of his fingers? In his notes, Dr. Killare specifies a lacerated right palm with rocks in the cut, code S61.421A, (laceration with foreign body of right hand) and abrasions to the left hand, code S60.512A (abrasion of left hand).\r\n\r\nDr. Killdare also documents that he found a tiny piece of rock in the cornea of Bill’s right eye, so we would add code T15.01xA (foreign body in cornea, right eye).\r\n\r\nDon’t forget to add W20.0xxA (struck by falling object in cave-in).\r\n\r\nThat’s all for Monday at Fix ‘Em Up. Remember to watch out for those falling rocks!',

		'body' : '...and the documentation coach will turn into a pumpkin if you\'re not on time. As a CDI specialist, what has been your approach to ICD-10? Are you hoping it will go away? Are you waiting for 2014? Are you preparing now?\r\n\r\nAlthough the official start date for ICD-10 CM and ICD-10 PCS is expected to move out to October 1, 2014, the start of fiscal year 2015, most hospitals should be, and are, preparing now. AHIMA has produced an ICD-10 <a href=\"http://library.ahima.org/xpedio/groups/public/documents/ahima/bok1_034622.hcsp?dDocName=bok1_034622\">checklist</a>, with a detailed timeline and suggestions as to who should be involved at what stage of the process. CDI specialists aren\'t specifically mentioned until the very end, as one group of the many users who will need ICD-10 education, but their role will be critical.\r\n\r\nAccording to the timeline, you should have already looked at your physicians\' documentation to see if it will stand up to ICD-10 coding requirements, and should be developing and implementing strategies to address any weaknesses in that documentation. You can\'t do that if you don\'t know ICD-10. If you are not expert in anatomy and physiology (A&amp;P), get refresher training now. While you are likely not coding the chart, you are ensuring that the documentation is sufficiently detailed to meet ICD-10 (especially PCS) coding requirements, and that means having expert understanding of A&amp;P.\r\n\r\nIf your hospital hasn\'t decided what changes to it needs to make in its electronic documentation processes, get involved. You are the experts on documentation requirements. It will be much easier to work the documentation requirements into the system before implementation than to try to retrofit a process into an existing system later.\r\n\r\nYou may think it is too early to learn about ICD-10, or that if you learn it now, you will forget it by the implementation date because you are still using ICD-9.  Think back to when you first learned the MS-DRG system and ICD-9-CM codes. How long did that take?  Aren\'t you still learning? Don\'t you have to give yourself time to become competent so that you can educate your doctors?\r\n\r\nConsider this:  Everything you teach physicians about documentation for ICD-10 will improve their documentation under ICD-9. Your coders are not going to complain that you enabled the physician to be too accurate.  When you send a query, physicians generally doesn\'t know or care about the coding rule or the classification system that triggered the query. They just know they have to answer to the level of detail you\'re asking, so start sending questions that generate ICD-10 compliant answers. When you learn ICD-10, you can start guiding your physicians in the right direction, and the official transition in 2014 will be much less painful.\r\n\r\nI liken the preparation for ICD-10 to that, a little more than a decade ago, for Y2K.  Some people feared disasters including nuclear holocaust, and when nothing happened on 1/1/2000, they were almost disappointed. In reality, the preparation had been impressively thorough and left nothing to chance. Although the world might not end if we aren\'t ready for ICD-10, getting all the details covered before the official implementation date can make the actual conversion a burp instead of an explosion.\r\n\r\nTraining seminars, boot camps, and books abound. Take advantage of everything that\'s offered, and ask for training if you haven\'t received any. If you\'re just starting to train, review CMS\'s <a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/ICD10/Downloads/ICD-10OverviewPowerPoint.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">overview</a> of ICD-10. The World Health Organization offers an ICD-10-CM online training <a href=\"http://apps.who.int/classifications/apps/icd/icd10training/ICD-10%20training/Start/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">tool</a> that\'s free and easy to use.\r\n\r\nAs a CDI consultant, I knew that at some point I would be required to provide ICD-10 documentation education to new CDI specialists. So I decided to pull out the ICD-10-CM official guidelines and actually compare them side by side with the ICD-9 CM guidelines . Not only did I learn about ICD-10-CM, but I refreshed my knowledge of ICD-9-CM.\r\n\r\nThen I began putting together a presentation on ICD-10-PCS, and by working my way through the definitions and the rules, I educated myself. By the time I finished the PowerPoint, not only did I have a greater understanding of the complexity of the documentation requirements, but I was able to code a simple procedure. I was very proud of myself, too! Now, I didn\'t become an ICD-10 expert that day, but by challenging myself to work with it, I found it much less frightening and mystifying.\r\n\r\nPlease don\'t wait for education to come to you.  Please don\'t wait for someone else to tell you what your CDI process should be.  Put the \"special\" in CDI specialist.\r\n\r\n<em>Editor’s note: We borrowed this post from our friends at the <a href=\"http://www.hcpro.com/acdis/\">Association for Clinical Documentation Specialists</a> and Linda Renee Brown, RN, CCRN, CCDS, MA.

It’s here! Run for your lives!\r\n\r\nOkay, we’re not about to be overrun by brain-munching undead. But as it turns out, several diseases could turn you into a zombie, if you got them all at once. Really, what are the chances of that happening? Let’s look at the diseases and see how we would code them in ICD-10-CM. Then we’ll be prepared when the zombie do eventually attack.\r\n\r\nFirst up is sleeping sickness. Odds are you won’t see these cases very often because it is more prevalent in Africa. Sleeping sickness is caused by the parasite <em>Trypanosoma brucei</em> and transmitted by the tsetse fly.\r\n\r\nWhen we look up sleeping sickness in the ICD-10-CM alphabetic index, we’re directed to sickness, sleeping. Really? They couldn’t just include it under sleeping sickness? Oh well, it’s only one page away in the 2012 index. It turns out we have three choices for sleeping sickness:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>B56.0, Gambiense trypanosomiasis\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Infection due to Trypanosoma brucei gambiense</li>\r\n	<li>West African sleeping sickness</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n	<li>B56.1, Rhodesiense trypanosomiasis\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>East African sleeping sickness</li>\r\n	<li>Infection due to Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n	<li>B56.9, African trypanosomiasis, unspecified\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Sleeping sickness NOS</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSo we need to know where our patient was when bitten by the tsetse fly. Avoid the unspecified unless you have no choice.\r\n\r\nAlthough no current medically recognized disease causes cannibalism, rabies could cause a zombie wannabe to seek out brains. Here again we need to know where our patient was when infected—an urban environment or a wooded one.\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>A82.0, sylvatic rabies</li>\r\n	<li>A82.1, urban rabies</li>\r\n	<li>A82.9, rabies, unspecified</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe also have some other choices under rabies when we look in the alphabetic index. The patient could have been exposed to rabies or come into contact with it, but not contracted it. In that case, we would report code Z20.3. Maybe our patient is trying to avoid becoming a zombie and received a rabies vaccine. That could lead to an inoculation reaction. The ICD-10-CM index directs us to complications, vaccination to find the code for the adverse reaction.\r\n\r\nWhat about the rotting flesh look most zombies fashion? That can be explained by necrosis. Technically, it’s not a disease but a condition with a lot of different possible causes—cancer, poison, injury, and infection among them.\r\n\r\nBut just to be sure we’re prepared; we’ll consider this as a cause of zombie-itis. We need a lot of information in order to code necrosis. The codes for necrosis are spread throughout the ICD-10-CM manual, depending on where the condition occurs.\r\n\r\nFor example, if our zombie showed necrosis of the jaw, which would explain the gaping mouth, we would report M27.2. If the necrosis occurred in the cornea (hence the poor eyesight), we would code H18.40 (unspecified corneal degeneration).  Even though the code doesn’t require laterality, it’s a good idea for the physician to document it. After all, you never know when your zombie will return.\r\n\r\nThe physician also needs to document all of the sites where necrosis occurs so we can report all of them, internal and external.\r\n\r\nWhat is causing our zombie’s shuffling gait? Could it be Hansen’s disease, aka leprosy? And yes, if you look up Hansen’s disease, the index directs you to leprosy, but if you look up leprosy, you’re in the right place. Assuming of course, the physician documents the type of leprosy our zombie contracted.\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>A30.0, indeterminate leprosy</li>\r\n	<li>A30.1, tuberculoid leprosy</li>\r\n	<li>A30.2, borderline tuberculoid leprosy</li>\r\n	<li>A30.3, borderline leprosy</li>\r\n	<li>A30.4, borderline lepromatous leprosy</li>\r\n	<li>A30.5, lepromatous leprosy</li>\r\n	<li>A30.8, other forms of leprosy</li>\r\n	<li>A30.9, leprosy, unspecified</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nRemember that other forms of leprosy and unspecified leprosy are two different things. If we code A30.8, we know what type of leprosy our zombie has, but ICD-10-CM doesn’t include a code for it. We would only report A30.9 if the physician didn’t document the type of leprosy and our query was unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nLet’s move on to our final sign of zombie-itis, the noises emulating from our zombie, specifically those moans and grunts. Turns out our zombie could be suffering from dysarthria, which is a disorder affecting the motor controls of human speech.\r\n\r\nBefore we can code, we need to know what caused it. A complete medical history is a must. So is complete documentation. It doesn’t do us any good if the physician knows this information but doesn’t write it down.\r\n\r\nDid our zombie suffer a nontraumatic intracerebral hemorrhage? If so, we would code I69.122. Maybe the dysarthria developed after a nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (I69.022), some other nontraumatic intracranial hemorrhage (I69.222), or possibly a cerebral infarction (I69.322).\r\n\r\nSo basically, as long as none of your patients come in with sleeping sickness, rabies, necrosis , leprosy, and dysarthria, you should be safe from zombies. But it wouldn’t hurt to put together one of the CDC’s zombie preparedness kits.',

Just ask the residents of Calamity Condos who are visiting the Fix ‘Em Up Clinic.\r\n\r\nTom and Wendy decided to repaint the living room of their condo. When it came time to paint the ceiling, Wendy picked up Hawkeye the cat to make things safer for Tom on the ladder. Alas, Tom leaned too far back on the ladder, overbalanced, and crashed to the floor. The thump scared Hawkeye, who clawed his way out of Wendy’s grip and headed off for parts unknown (and presumably quieter).\r\n\r\nDr. Crusher notes that she is seeing Tom for the first time for injuries suffered during the fall from the ladder. She documents Tom sustained a concussion, lower back contusion, and sprained wrist in the fall.\r\n\r\nSo how do we code Tom’s injuries? First we need to know if he lost consciousness when he fell and if so, for how long. ICD-10-CM includes 10 codes for concussions, from no loss of consciousness to loss of consciousness of any duration, with death due to other cause prior to regaining consciousness.\r\n\r\nWe don’t see any documentation of loss of consciousness in Dr. Crusher’s note, but we send a query just to make sure that means Tom didn’t lose consciousness. Dr. Crusher confirms he did not, so we would report S06.0X0A (concussion without loss of consciousness).\r\n\r\nFor Tom’s contusion of the lower back, we would report S30.0XXA. Note that we need two placeholders in this code because we need a seventh character to denote the encounter type.\r\n\r\nThat brings us to Tom’s sprained wrist. Sprained wrist is not going to cut it as far as coding goes. We need to know which wrist and which joint Tom sprained.  When we look through Dr. Crusher’s notes, we find documentation stating a sprain of the left radiocarpal joint, which leads to code S63.522A.\r\n\r\nAnd let’s not forget the code for falling from the ladder. In ICD-9-CM, we would look for an E code, but in ICD-10-CM, we head to Chapter 20, External causes of morbidity (V00-Y99). Tom’s tumble from the ladder leads us to code W11 (fall on or from ladder). The category doesn’t include any additional subcodes, but it does include a note to add the appropriate seventh character. Since Dr. Crusher is treating Tom for the initial visit for the fall, we would report W11.XXXA.\r\n\r\nWhat about poor Wendy? She ended up with lacerations in multiple locations as a result of Hawkeye’s getaway. We need to report each location that Dr. Crusher documented, which include the right upper arm and forearm, left forearm, right thumb, and right index finger. Hawkeye also bit Wendy’s right index finger in his bid for freedom. So we would code:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S41.111A, laceration without foreign body of right upper arm</li>\r\n	<li>S51.811A, laceration without foreign body of right forearm</li>\r\n	<li>S51.812A, laceration without foreign body of left forearm</li>\r\n	<li>S60.470A, other superficial bite of right index finger</li>\r\n	<li>S61.011A, laceration without foreign body of right thumb without damage to nail</li>\r\n	<li>S61.210A, laceration without foreign body of right index finger without damage to nail</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIf Hawkeye had scratched more fingers and Dr. Crusher had documented it, we would continue to add codes. Because Dr. Crusher documented lacerations to both the right and left forearms, we code for both. If she didn’t specify which arm was involved, we would query and if we weren’t able to get clarification, we would be forced to report the unspecified code S51.819 (laceration without foreign body of unspecified forearm).\r\n\r\nThat might not make much of a difference initially, but at some point, third-party payers may decide not to pay for unspecified laterality. And really, physicians should know where the specific injury is located. We just need to get them to write in down.\r\n\r\nHere’s the other problem with that unspecified code. In our example, Wendy suffered lacerations to both arms and Dr. Crusher documented those injuries. As a result, we report two codes and should be reimbursed for both. Different sides of the body, different injuries. However, if we report the unspecified code, we’re missing out on half of the reimbursement because we’re only getting paid for the lacerations on one arm. Think about pointing that out to your physicians, in a polite way.\r\n\r\nAs we continue reading through Dr. Crusher’s notes, we find this notation: “Patient complains of nausea from paint fumes, no vomiting. Patient says smell of paint often makes her nauseous.” That means we need to check the Table of Drugs and Chemicals to find a code for poisoning by paint fumes.\r\n\r\nIn the Table of Drugs and Chemicals, under paint, we find five choices:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Cleaner</li>\r\n	<li>Fumes NEC</li>\r\n	<li>Lead (fumes)</li>\r\n	<li>Solvent NEC</li>\r\n	<li>Stripper</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nDr. Crusher documented that the paint fumes made Wendy sick. Clearly this is an accidental poisoning, so we would report T59.891 (toxic effect of other specified gases, fumes and vapors, accidental [unintentional]). We also report code R11.0 (nausea without vomiting).\r\n\r\nDr. Crusher is also seeing Roger, another resident of Calamity Condos. Two weeks ago, Roger cut off part of his left thumb with a table saw. Ouch. Today he’s back for a routine follow up for the partial traumatic metacarpophalangeal amputation of left thumb. Dr. Crusher documents the injury is healing well, so we would report S68.022D (partial traumatic metacarpophalangeal amputation of left thumb). Notice the seventh character in this case is D for a subsequent encounter. If Dr. Crusher had documented some type of adverse after effect, we would have used S for the seventh character for sequela.\r\n\r\nOur final victim of the Calamity Condo fixing up, Steve, comes in with crushed toes. He dropped a sink on his foot while he was trying to lift it into place. Dr. Crusher documents crush injuries to the great toe and two of the lesser toes on Steve’s right foot. She also documents this is an initial visit.\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S97.111A, crushing injury of right great toe</li>\r\n	<li>S97.121A, crushing injury of right lesser toe(s)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe would only report two codes, even though three toes are involved because S97.121A specifies toe or toes. So even if Steve crushed all four of the lesser toes, we would still only report one code.\r\n\r\nWe would also want to report the falling sink as the cause of Steve’s injuries, so we would also report W20.8XXA (other cause of strike by thrown, projected or falling object).\r\n\r\nThat appears to be our last do-it-yourself project injury. Just remember if you undertake any home repairs or improvements, watch out for falling objects, falling people, and easily startled felines.',

		'body' : 'Certain conditions have both an underlying etiology and multiple body system manifestations due to the underlying etiology. ICD-10-CM coding conventions for such conditions require coders to report the underlying condition first followed by the manifestation.\r\n\r\nWherever such a combination exists, coders will notice a “use additional code” note for the etiology code, and a “code first” note for the manifestation code. These instructional notes indicate the proper sequencing order of the codes, which is etiology followed by manifestation.\r\n\r\nManifestation code titles generally will include “in diseases classified elsewhere.” The following example includes a code title that is indicative of  a manifestation code.\r\n\r\n<strong><em>E35, disorders of endocrine glands in diseases classified elsewhere</em></strong>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Code first underlying disease, such as:</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>late congenital syphilis of thymus gland [Dubois disease] (A50.5)</em></p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>tuberculous calcification of adrenal gland (B90.8)</em></p>\r\nCoders may not report  “in diseases classified elsewhere” codes as first-listed or principal diagnosis codes. Coders may report them only in conjunction with an underlying condition code and must always sequence them after the underlying condition.\r\n\r\nSome manifestation code titles don’t include “in diseases classified elsewhere.”  However, these codes include a “use additional code” note and they are subject to the same sequencing rules.\r\n\r\nFor example, ICD-10-CM code A48.52 (wound botulism) does not include “in diseases classified elsewhere,” but a note instructs coders to “use additional code for associated wound”.\r\n\r\nThese conditions also have a specific Alphabetic Index entry structure. The ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index lists both codes together with etiology codes first followed by manifestation codes in brackets. Coders must always report etiology codes first.\r\n\r\n“Code first” and “Use additional code” notes also serve as sequencing rules in the classification of certain codes that are not part of an etiology/ manifestation combination.',

The guidelines instruct coders not to report signs and symptoms routinely associated with a disease process, unless otherwise instructed by the classification.\r\n\r\nCoders should report additional signs and symptoms that may not be routinely associated with a disease process when present, and of course, documented.\r\n\r\nFor example, a physician may document that a patient suffered from nausea and vomiting. Does this necessitate code assignment?  Unfortunately for coders, the answer is sometimes yes, sometimes no. If a physician diagnoses a patient with allergic and dietetic gastroenteritis and colitis (ICD-10-CM code K52.2), coders shouldn’t report a code for nausea and vomiting. These symptoms are integral parts of the disease.\r\n\r\nConsider what happens if a physician diagnoses a patient with irritable bowel syndrome without diarrhea (ICD-10-CM code K58.9) and documents nausea and vomiting. In this case, coders should report nausea and vomiting with the appropriate code from the R11- series. Nausea and vomiting are not common symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome.',

		'status' : 1,
		'summary' : '',
		'body' : 'Gregory House, MD, is hanging up his stethoscope before the transition to ICD-10-CM. I loved House MD  when Fox first starting airing it in 2005, but the last few seasons, not so much.\r\n\r\nLet’s ask Dr. House and his merry band of diagnosticians to treat one more patient and see how we would code for that diagnosis in ICD-10-CM.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, the team’s diagnosis of choice at the start is often sarcoidosis (and it<em>never </em>turned out to be sarcoidosis by the end of the show). For a change, let’s say Dr. House et al actually identified the correct diagnosis at first guess. The first thing we need to know is where is it—lungs, lymph nodes, skin, or maybe somewhere else. The “somewhere else” is where we get lots of choices:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>D86.81, sarcoid meningitis</li>\r\n	<li>D86.82, multiple cranial nerve palsies in sarcoidosis</li>\r\n	<li>D86.83, sarcoid iridocyclitis</li>\r\n	<li>D86.84, sarcoid pyelonephritis</li>\r\n	<li>D86.85, sarcoid myocarditis</li>\r\n	<li>D86.86, sarcoid arthropathy</li>\r\n	<li>D86.87, sarcoid myositis</li>\r\n	<li>D86.89, sarcoidosis of other sites</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nOkay, it’s really not sarcoidosis, so let’s consider some other possibilities. Perhaps the team mixed up its S diseases and the patient really has scleroderma. Scleroderma by itself doesn’t give us all the information we need to code. In ICD-10-CM, we can choose from two codes (provided Dr. House documents enough information):\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>L94.0, localized scleroderma [morphea]</li>\r\n	<li>L94.1, linear scleroderma</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nMaybe our patient suffers from a systemic connective tissue disorder. An Excludes1 note under Category L94- (other localized connective tissue disorders) directs coders to codes M30-M36. Remember that Excludes1 notes mean “not coded here”. So if Dr. House concludes that the patient actually has lupus, we would look to series M32 (systemic lupus erythematosus).\r\n\r\nAs you probably guessed, lupus alone isn’t enough to select a code. Even systemic lupus erythematosus doesn’t provide all the detail we need. Although ICD-10-CM does contain an unspecified code, we really should query Dr. House for more information. Is the systemic lupus erythematosus drug-induced? Are systems or organs involved? The answers to those questions will drive code selection. Our choices for systemic lupus erythematosus with organ or system involvement include:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>M32.10, systemic lupus erythematosus, organ or system involvement unspecified</li>\r\n	<li>M32.11, endocarditis in systemic lupus erythematosus</li>\r\n	<li>M32.12, pericarditis in systemic lupus erythematosus</li>\r\n	<li>M32.13, lung involvement in systemic lupus erythematosus</li>\r\n	<li>M32.14, glomerular disease in systemic lupus erythematosus</li>\r\n	<li>M32.15, tubulo-interstitial nephropathy in systemic lupus erythematosus</li>\r\n	<li>M32.19, other organ or system involvement in systemic lupus erythematosus</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIf we stick with our autoimmune theme, maybe our patient suffers from vasculitis. That’s always popular with Dr. House as a rule out diagnosis. Vasculitis is the name for several diseases that cause an inflammation of the walls of blood vessels, so we need a lot more information from Dr. House and his team.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for our patient, Dr. House documents Churg-Strauss vasculitis, which doesn’t have a cure. Fortunately for us, we only have one possible code: M30.1 (polyarteritis with lung involvement).\r\n\r\nIf the patient suffered from rheumatoid vasculitis with rheumatoid arthritis (M05.2-) we would need to know where the vasculitis is located:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>M05.21, rheumatoid vasculitis with rheumatoid arthritis of shoulder</li>\r\n	<li>M05.22, rheumatoid vasculitis with rheumatoid arthritis of elbow</li>\r\n	<li>M05.23, rheumatoid vasculitis with rheumatoid arthritis of wrist</li>\r\n	<li>M05.24, rheumatoid vasculitis with rheumatoid arthritis of hand</li>\r\n	<li>M05.25, rheumatoid vasculitis with rheumatoid arthritis of hip</li>\r\n	<li>M05.26, rheumatoid vasculitis with rheumatoid arthritis of knee</li>\r\n	<li>M05.27, rheumatoid vasculitis with rheumatoid arthritis of ankle and foot</li>\r\n	<li>M05.29, rheumatoid vasculitis with rheumatoid arthritis of multiple sites</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWith the exception of M05.29, we need to report a sixth character to indicate laterality (right, left, bilateral, unspecified) for these codes.\r\n\r\nMaybe it isn’t autoimmune after all. What else could Dr. House pull out of his bag of dangerous diagnoses? How about some exotic disease, like leishmaniasis? I’m not sure how a Jersey housewife gets bitten by a sand flea, but stranger things have happened.\r\n\r\nIt turns out we have multiple choices even for leishmaniasis:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>B55.0, visceral leishmaniasis</li>\r\n	<li>B55.1, cutaneous leishmaniasis</li>\r\n	<li>B55.2, mucocutaneous leishmaniasis</li>\r\n	<li>B55.9, leishmaniasis, unspecified</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nMaybe it was just a regular flea that bit the patient and she actually suffers from tularemia. In that case, we need enough documentation to choose from these codes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>A21.0, ulceroglandular tularemia</li>\r\n	<li>A21.1, oculoglandular tularemia</li>\r\n	<li>A21.2, pulmonary tularemia</li>\r\n	<li>A21.3, gastrointestinal tularemia</li>\r\n	<li>A21.7, generalized tularemia</li>\r\n	<li>A21.8, other forms of tularemia</li>\r\n	<li>A21.9, tularemia, unspecified</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nPerhaps it’s actually schistosomiasis, another disease that often shows up in the differential at Princeton Plainsboro. If it actually is schistosomiasis, we would choose from these codes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>B65.0, Schistosomiasis due to Schistosoma haematobium [urinary schistosomiasis]</li>\r\n	<li>B65.1, Schistosomiasis due to Schistosoma mansoni [intestinal schistosomiasis]</li>\r\n	<li>B65.2, Schistosomiasis due to Schistosoma japonicum</li>\r\n	<li>B65.3, Cercarial dermatitis</li>\r\n	<li>B65.8, Other schistosomiasis</li>\r\n	<li>B65.9, Schistosomiasis, unspecified</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWell, we’re down to the last commercial break and our patient still doesn’t have a definitive diagnosis. Things aren’t looking good, until Dr. House comes up with a brilliant deduction just in time to save the patient. She’s actually suffering from West Nile virus (those pesky mosquitoes!).\r\n\r\nAgain we need additional documentation  so we can code the correct form of West Nile virus:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>A92.30, West Nile virus infection, unspecified</li>\r\n	<li>A92.31, West Nile virus infection with encephalitis</li>\r\n	<li>A92.32, West Nile virus infection with other neurologic manifestation\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Use additional code to specify the neurologic manifestation</li>\r\n	<li>A92.39, West Nile virus infection with other complications\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Use additional code to specify the other conditions</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nNotice that two of the codes include notes to use additional codes to specify the neurologic manifestation or other conditions. Make sure you don’t forget those codes.\r\n\r\nAnd with that brilliant, last-minute save, Dr. House hangs up his stethoscope, fires up his motorcycle, and heads off into the sunset.',

It seems a group of vampires is trying to one-up the zombies. But, never fear, vampires can actually be regular people suffering from codeable medical illnesses, just like the zombies.\r\n\r\nHave you noticed how pale vampires are, especially Robert Pattinson in the ‘Twilight’ movies? Turns out, they could be suffering from anemia. We need a lot more information in order to code anemia in ICD-10-CM.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, what type of anemia is it? ICD-10-CM includes three major categories:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>D50-D53, nutritional anemias</li>\r\n	<li>D55-D59, hemolytic anemias, which involve the premature destruction of red blood cells</li>\r\n	<li>D60-D64, aplastic and other anemias and other bone marrow failure syndromes</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSo we need to narrow down what type of anemia our vampire has before we can even determine which series of codes to use. Keep in mind that each series of codes includes numerous subcategories that require specific documentation.\r\n\r\nFor example, if our vampire suffers from hemolytic anemia, we need to know the cause. Is it a hereditary condition or an acquired one? Is it due to an enzyme disorder and if so, which one? Maybe our vampire suffers from thalassemia, in which the body makes an abnormal form of hemoglobin. If it’s thalassemia, we need to know which specific form:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Alpha</li>\r\n	<li>Beta</li>\r\n	<li>Delta-beta</li>\r\n	<li>Thalassemia minor</li>\r\n	<li>Hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin</li>\r\n	<li>Hemoglobin E-beta</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSome form of anemia probably accounts for our vampire’s pale complexion, but what about that whole “burst into flames in sunlight” thing?\r\n\r\nIt’s not as far out as you might think. Our vampire may suffer from porphyria, conditions that can affect the skin and nervous system. People with porphyria have a deficiency in one of the eight enzymes responsible for producing the chemical reactions necessary to produce heme. Of the eight different types of porphyria, four can sometimes cause sensitivity to light, but won’t cause the sufferer to spontaneously combust:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Erythropoietic protoporphyria or protoporphyria (ICD-10-CM code E80.0)</li>\r\n	<li>Congenital erythropoietic porphyria  (E80.0)</li>\r\n	<li>Porphyria cutanea tarda (E80.1)</li>\r\n	<li>Variegate porphyria, a form of acute intermittent (hepatic) porphyria (E80.21)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nPerhaps our vampire suffers from a more common condition, known as polymorphous light eruption, which is characterized by the formation of bumpy and itchy rashes on sun-exposed skin. The symptoms are similar to a sunburn, and you’ll find the ICD-10-CM code (L56.4) in the radiation-related disorders of the skin and subcutaneous tissue series, like sunburn.\r\n\r\nFor our inpatient coders, ICD-10-CM L56.4 is part of MS-DRG:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>606 Minor skin disorders with MCC</li>\r\n	<li>607 Minor skin disorders without MCC</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIf you’ve ever seen the really old vampire movies (or even just some of the clips), the vampire is often portrayed as being stiff as a board when he rises from his coffin. He also sleeps with his eyes open. And really, if someone was trying to put a stake through your heart, you’d probably sleep with your eyes open too.\r\n\r\nHowever, our vampire may be suffering from an actual medical condition, not just a concern for personal safety. Catalepsy is a nervous condition characterized by muscular rigidity and fixity of posture regardless of external stimuli, as well as decreased sensitivity to pain. A person suffering from catalepsy can see and hear but cannot move. Their breathing, pulse, and other regulatory functions are so slow that the person appears to be  dead.  That explains the rising from the dead without being a zombie.  We have two codes to choose from for catalepsy:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>F20.2, catatonic schizophrenia</li>\r\n	<li>F44.2, catalepsy(hysterical)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAlternately, our vampire may just be hypnotized and wearing stage makeup. In that case, we can put away the garlic and go back to watching <em>Twilight: Breaking Dawn</em> or better yet, <em>The Lost Boys</em>.',

		'body' : 'In ICD-10-CM, coders must report two codes to fully describe certain conditions.  They will find “Use additional code” notes in the Tabular List at codes when they need to report a secondary code to fully describe a condition. Report the “use additional code” as a secondary code.\r\n\r\nFor example, a patient comes in to the ED for a bacterial infection. Depending on the specific infection, coders may need to include a code from category B95 (Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, and Enterococcus as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere) or B96 (other bacterial agents as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere) to identify the bacterial organism causing the infection. Coders will normally find a “use additional code” note at the infectious disease code, indicating a need for the organism code to be added as a secondary code.\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM also includes “code first” notes under certain codes that are not specifically manifestation codes but may be caused by an underlying cause. When coders see a “code first” note and the physician documents the presence of an underlying condition, report the underlying condition first.\r\n\r\nFor example, the physician documents a major osseous defect of the lower right leg (M89.761). Under the heading “Major osseous defect” (M89.-) coders find a note that instructs them to code first underlying disease, if known, such as:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Aseptic necrosis of bone (M87.-)</li>\r\n	<li>Malignant neoplasm of bone (C40.-)</li>\r\n	<li>Osteolysis (M89.5)</li>\r\n	<li>Osteomyelitis (M86.-)</li>\r\n	<li>Osteonecrosis (M87.-)</li>\r\n	<li>Osteoporosis (M80.-, M81.-)</li>\r\n	<li>Periprosthetic osteolysis (T84.05-)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n“Code, if applicable, any causal condition first” notes indicate that this code may be assigned as a principal diagnosis when the causal condition is unknown or not applicable. If the physician documents a causal condition, coders should report the code for that condition as the principal or first-listed diagnosis.\r\n\r\nFor example, a male patient suffers from nocturia caused by an enlarged prostate. The code for nocturia (R35.1) includes a note directing coders to first code any known causal condition, such as an enlarged prostate (N40.1).',

		'body' : 'Our Town Zoo hosted its annual black tie fundraiser and things got a little, well, wild as the patients at the Fix ‘Em Up Clinic prove.\r\n\r\nTiffany made a fashion statement with a bright blue shimmering gown that drew plenty of positive comments. Unfortunately for her, she also drew the attention of the zoo’s free-roaming peahen. The peahen was not pleased to discover Tiffany was not a potential mate and decided to peck the dress to pieces.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_2809\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Watch out for free-roaming peahens!\"]<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Peahen-21.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-2809\" title=\"Peahen 2\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Peahen-21-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>[/caption]\r\n\r\nDr. Doolittle documents a thigh laceration, finger laceration, and superficial bite of the hand. What do we need to know to code this encounter? First of all, we need to the specific locations of Tiffany’s wounds. Which thigh did the peahen injure? According to Dr. Doolittle’s notes, the right thigh.\r\n\r\nOkay, so what about the finger laceration—which hand and which specific finger? Dr. Doolittle documented a laceration of a blood vessel of the index finger. He doesn’t state which side, so we’ll query for that information.\r\n\r\nHow about the superficial bite of the hand? Again we need to know which hand and Dr. Doolittle didn’t document that information either. So we’ll send another query.\r\n\r\nDr. Doolittle answers our query by stating “right index finger” and “right hand.”  We also need to know what episode of care we are dealing with—initial, subsequent, or sequel? Dr. Doolittle’s notes state Tiffany is seeking treatment for the first time. So we need to append a seventh character of A.\r\n\r\nSo we would code:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S71.111A, laceration without foreign body, right thigh</li>\r\n	<li>S65.510A, laceration of blood vessel of right index finger</li>\r\n	<li>S60.371A, other superficial bite of right thumb</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe also need to code for the cause of injury, in Tiffany’s case, attack by a peahen. Peafowl do not have their own ICD-10-CM codes, so we need to default to “other birds.” That leads us to:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>W61.91XA, bitten by other birds</li>\r\n	<li>W61.92XA, struck by other birds</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAnd since the injuries occurred at the zoo, we would also add:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Y92.834, zoological garden (Zoo) as the place of occurrence of the external cause</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBen and Dom got into a slugfest while debating whether gibbons are apes or monkeys. Turns out, they’re apes.\r\n\r\nBen suffered a broken nose, two black eyes, and a broken hand. Ben apparently missed Dom and hit the wall of the gibbons’ exhibit. We need to check for laterality for the broken hand, as well as documentation of which specific bone Ben broke. We also need to know the encounter for all of Ben’s injuries. Dr. Doolittle documents a broken right hand a<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Gibbon-2.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-2769\" title=\"Gibbon 2\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Gibbon-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"156\" height=\"161\" /></a>nd notes he is seeing Ben for initial treatment of his injuries. Unfortunately, we need more than just “right hand” for Ben’s fracture. So we query Dr. Doolittle and ask for information on which bone Ben broke. Dr. Doolittle documents fractures of the third and fourth metacarpal bones. That’s still not enough information. Are the fractures displaced or non-displaced? Did Ben break the shaft, neck, or base of the bones or more than one area? So we’ll send another query.\r\n\r\nBy this point, Dr. Doolittle is more than a little annoyed with us. He sends back a note stating: “Non-displaced fracture of shaft of third metacarpal and shaft of fourth metacarpal. Now go away!”\r\n\r\nWe would report:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S02.2XXA, fracture of nasal bones</li>\r\n	<li>S00.11XA, contusion of right eyelid and periocular area</li>\r\n	<li>S00.12XA, contusion of left eyelid and periocular area</li>\r\n	<li>S62.352A, nondisplaced fracture of shaft of third metacarpal bone, right hand</li>\r\n	<li>S62.354A, nondisplaced fracture of shaft of fourth metacarpal bone, right hand</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe also need to add Y92.834 to show Ben suffered his injuries at the zoo.\r\n\r\nSo what about the fight? Should we code that as well? We certainly can, because ICD-10-CM includes a code for assault by unarmed brawl or fight (Y04.0XXA).\r\n\r\nMoving on to the other fight participant, Dr. Doolittle documents Dom suffered contusions to his right hand and a displaced fracture of the right thumb, as well as a laceration to his lip with no foreign body.\r\n\r\nAs we read through Dr. Doolittle’s notes, we find out this is Dom’s first visit for these injuries, which tells us we’ll use seventh character A. Dr. Doolittle also noted: “Dislocated fracture, distal phalanx, right thumb confirmed by X-ray.” That gives us all of the information we need to code this encounter. We would report:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S62.521A, displaced fracture of distal phalanx of right thumb</li>\r\n	<li>S60.221A, contusion of right hand</li>\r\n	<li>S01.511A, laceration without foreign body of lip</li>\r\n	<li>Y92.834, zoological garden (Zoo) as the place of occurrence of the external cause</li>\r\n	<li>Y04.0XXA, assault by unarmed brawl or fight</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nOur final casualty from the zoo fundraiser is Blanche, who fell in front of the flamingo exhibit and suffered contusions to her knees and abrasions to her palms, not to mention ruining a lovely dress. Dr. Doolittle documents Blanche’s palm and knee injuries are bilateral and this is her first visit.\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S80.01XA, contusion of right knee, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S80.02XA, contusion of right knee, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S60.511A, abrasion of right hand</li>\r\n	<li>S60.512A, abrasion of left hand</li>\r\n	<li>Y92.834, zoological garden (Zoo) as the place of occurrence of the external cause</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe do need some additional information in order to code for Blanche’s fall. Did she strike an object when she fell (other than the ground)? Did she fall because she collided with someone else? Did her heel break and cause the fall?\r\n\r\nFortunately, Blanche offered a complete description of her accident and Dr. Doolittle dutifully documented it.  Blanche was trying to get a very close look at the flamingos, struck the glass of the enclosure, and fell. That leads us to W18.02XA (striking against glass with subsequent fall).\r\n\r\nThe next time you attend a fundraiser at the zoo, be sure to remain alert. It’s a jungle out there.',

		'body' : 'Summer semi-officially arrived this week with Memorial Day and that means plenty of sun and sand related illnesses at the Fix ‘Em Up Clinic.\r\n\r\nOur first patient is Todd, who was trying to grill up the perfect Memorial Day feast in his backyard. Apparently he turned up the flame on the grill too high and burned not only the burgers, but himself as well. Ouch.\r\n\r\nSo how do we code Todd’s burns in ICD-10-CM? Burns and corrosions fall under series T20-T32. These codes include thermal burns caused by:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Electrical heating appliances</li>\r\n	<li>Electricity</li>\r\n	<li>Flame</li>\r\n	<li>Friction</li>\r\n	<li>Hot air and hot gases</li>\r\n	<li>Hot objects</li>\r\n	<li>Lightning</li>\r\n	<li>Radiation</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSince we know Todd burned himself on a flame, we’re in the right starting place. Next we need to know where specifically did Todd burn himself and how serious the burns are. Dr. Scorcher documents first-degree burns of the right hand and forearm.\r\n\r\nNotice that the description of codes for burns of the forearm specify that they do not include the hand or wrist. That tells us we’ll need at least two codes—one for the hand, one for the arm.\r\n\r\nWe also need to know whether Dr. Scorcher is seeing Todd for the first time (she is according to her notes). That leads us to code T22.111A (burn of first degree of right forearm). Separate codes identify burns to the elbow, shoulder, and maxilla, so make sure your physicians are documenting the exact location. If they aren’t, query, don’t assume or guess.\r\n\r\nMoving on to Todd’s hand, we know we’re dealing with the right hand, first degree burns, and the initial encounter. That leads us to…more questions. We need to know exactly where Todd burned his hand. Palm, back of the hand, or multiple sites? Any fingers involved?\r\n\r\nDr. Scorcher didn’t include that information in her description of the injuries, but in her treatment plan, she instructs Todd to cover the burns on the back of his hand and his index and middle fingers with a sterile gauze bandage. And <em>voilà</em>, we have locations.\r\n\r\nIn our ICD-10-CM Manual, we find these codes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>T23.161A, burn of first degree of back of right hand</li>\r\n	<li>T23.131A, burn of first degree of multiple right fingers (nail), not including thumb</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe codes for the burn to the forearm, hand, and fingers all include the following note: Use additional external cause code to identify the source, place and intent of the burn (X00-X19, X75-X77, X96-X98, Y92). So we know we’ll need some additional codes for Todd’s misadventure.\r\n\r\nOur first stop is the X03 (exposure to controlled fire, not in building or structure) series of codes. We know Todd was outside when he burned himself, so we would not use a code from X02 (Exposure to controlled fire in building or structure).  Based on the information Todd gave Dr. Scorcher, we would report:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>X03.0XXA, exposure to flames in controlled fire, not in building or structure</li>\r\n	<li>Y93.G2, activity, grilling and smoking food</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe do not need any codes from X75-X77 (intentional self-harm) or X96-X98 (assault) because Todd’s injuries were caused by carelessness.\r\n\r\nTodd’s cooking proved hazardous to other people’s health as well. His sister Mary, one of his guests, came in with food poisoning caused by undercooked chicken. Apparently Todd turned the flame down a little too much after burning himself.\r\n\r\nFood poisoning comes in a lot of forms from a lot of bacteria, including campylobacter, salmonella, shigella, e. coli O157:H7, listeria, and botulism. In this case, we know Mary suffered from a salmonella infection, but we need to know if it’s salmonella enteritis, salmonella sepsis, or a localized salmonella infection. Dr. Scorcher documents salmonella enteritis, which leads us to ICD-10-CM code A02.0.\r\n\r\nSo much for the food-related mishaps at the Memorial Day cookout. Unfortunately, that doesn’t signal the end of the injuries for Todd’s guests. Several members of the younger crowd decided on a game of volleyball, which ended badly for Andrea and Clara. Andrea suffered a strained her back and ended up at Fix ‘Em Up.\r\n\r\nWhen we look up strain in the ICD-10-CM Manual, we find code S39.012, strain of muscle, fascia and tendon of lower back. We need a seventh character to indicate the encounter in order to make the code valid. Dr. Scorcher documented this as Andrea’s first visit, so the complete code would be S39.012A.\r\n\r\nWe can also add Y93.68 (activity, volleyball [beach] [court]) to show what Andrea was doing when injured. In looking through Dr. Scorcher’s notes, we learn that the game was played in the backyard of Todd’s single-family house, so we can add Y92.017 (garden or yard in single-family [private] house as the place of occurrence of the external cause).\r\n\r\nAs a side note, when you look up strain in the ICD-10-CM index, you find some strains listed, but also notes directing you to look up injury, muscle, by site strain, for muscle and tendon strains. So looking up strain may not be your final stop in the index.\r\n\r\nThat leaves poor Clara. She wasn’t playing volleyball, but the game did her in anyway. She was struck by the volleyball and suffered a broken nose and a mild concussion. Again we need to know the encounter (documented as initial) and we also need to know if Clara lost consciousness (she didn’t).\r\n\r\nWe would report:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S02.2XXA fracture of nasal bones</li>\r\n	<li>S06.0X0A, concussion without loss of consciousness</li>\r\n	<li>W21.06XA, struck by volleyball</li>\r\n	<li>Y92.017, garden or yard in single-family (private) house as the place of occurrence of the external cause</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAnd with that, I am ordering takeout and going inside to watch Frozen Planet. That should be safe, right?',

		'body' : 'A writer paints a picture with words. The English language alone offers somewhere in the neighborhood of a quarter of a million words. But really how many does the average person use? According to Stephen Pinker\'s book “The Language Instinct” the average American high-school graduate knows approximately 45,000 words. That’s  a pretty big disparity, but it makes sense.\r\n\r\nHow many people do you know who use antidisestablishmentarianism in regular conversation? By the way, antidisestablishmentarianism is the longest non-technical and non-coined word in the English language (watching Jeopardy! pays).\r\n\r\nSome other odd words that you’ve probably never heard of include:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Erinaceous (like a hedgehog)</li>\r\n	<li>Lamprophony (loudness and clarity of voice)</li>\r\n	<li>Depone (to testify under oath)</li>\r\n	<li>Finnimbrun (a trinket or knick-knack)</li>\r\n	<li>Floccinaucinihilipilification (estimation that something is valueless)</li>\r\n	<li>Inaniloquent (pertaining to idle talk)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSo what does this have to do with coding in general and ICD-10-CM coding in particular? A coder tells a story with codes. Like any good storyteller, you want that story to be as complete and accurate as possible. ICD-10-CM’s increased specificity will help you do that.\r\n\r\nA lot of people get hung up on the huge increase in the number of codes. ICD-9-CM includes 14,567 diagnosis codes, while ICD-10-CM offers 69,833. Big, scary difference, right? Yes and no. You’ll have a lot more choices, but that doesn’t mean you’ll use them.\r\n\r\nHow often does a patient come in for a spacecraft fire injuring occupant (V95.44) or for being bitten by an orca (W56.21)? For that matter, how many cases of light chain deposition disease or variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease or Pallister-Killian mosaic syndrome do you see?\r\n\r\nIf you code for a specialty, you’ll generally use a small fraction of the available codes. Even if you code for several specialties, you still won’t use every code.\r\n\r\nAnd a lot of the codes are just more detailed. They aren’t new conditions or new diseases. For example, look at the codes for serous detachment of retinal pigment epithelium. ICD-9-CM offers one code choice—362.42. So you’re coding this condition now. The difference is when you get to ICD-10-CM, you’ll have four choices:\r\n\r\nH35.721, serous detachment of retinal pigment epithelium, right eye\r\n\r\nH35.722, serous detachment of retinal pigment epithelium, left eye\r\n\r\nH35.723, serous detachment of retinal pigment epithelium, bilateral\r\n\r\nH35.729, serous detachment of retinal pigment epithelium, unspecified eye\r\n\r\nThe additional specificity could be an unexpected aid as well. Because many ICD-10-CM codes include laterality, you shouldn’t have to worry that a payer will reject a claim because of double billing if you can code two separate sites (index finger and middle finger) or different sides of the body (right arm and left arm).\r\n\r\nDon’t get stuck on the number of new codes. You don’t need to memorize them and you won’t have to relearn how to code diagnoses from scratch. Probably 90-95% of the coding guidelines remain the same. It’s a big change and will certainly be a challenge, but don’t be afraid of the choices.',

		'body' : 'The <em>ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting</em> now include guidelines for coding methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), so let’s look at how to code MRSA.\r\n\r\nThe physician diagnoses a patient with an infection due to MRSA. If that infection has a combination code that includes the causal organism (e.g., sepsis, pneumonia), you should assign the appropriate combination code for the condition. For example, if the patient has sepsis due to MRSA, report code A41.02.  For a patient with pneumonia due to MRSA, report code J15.212.\r\n\r\nCoders should not assign code B95.62 (MRSA infection as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere) as an additional code because the combination code includes the type of infection and the MRSA organism. Do not assign a code from subcategory Z16.11 (resistance to penicillins), as an additional diagnosis.\r\n\r\nLet’s change the scenario a little. The physician documents infection due to MRSA and the condition does not have a combination code that includes the causal organism. Some examples include wound infection, stitch abscess, and urinary tract infection. In this case, code the condition first, then add B95.62 for the MRSA infection. You still should not assign a code from subcategory Z16.11.',

		'body' : 'Anytown High School held its commencement ceremony over the weekend and it turned out to be a memorable event for more than the usual reason.\r\n\r\nClass president Marina decided to wear a pair of really, really high heels to make a graduation fashion statement. Unfortunately, she forgot to practice walking in them first. When she tried to walk up the steps to the stage to make her speech, she twisted her ankle and went sprawling. She came into the Fix ‘Em Up Clinic and saw Dr. Bunsen Honeydew.\r\n\r\nAccording to Dr. Honeydew’s notes, Marina sprained the internal collateral ligament and calcaneofibular ligament in her left ankle. She also dislocated her left wrist when she fell.\r\n\r\nWell, Dr. Honeydew did a good job documenting the ankle sprain. The only thing we don’t immediately see is the episode of care. But if we look at the top of his note, we learn that he is seeing Marina for the first time.\r\n\r\nThe code for the calcaneofibular  ligament is easy to find: S93.412A (sprain of calcaneofibular ligament of left ankle), but ICD-10-CM doesn’t include a code specifically for the internal collateral ligament. We did find S93.402A (sprain of unspecified ligament of left ankle), but Dr. Honeydew did identify the ligament so that doesn’t seem right.\r\n\r\nIf we keep looking down the list of codes for ankle ligament sprains, we eventually come to S93.49 (sprain of other ligament of ankle), where we do find the internal collateral ligament listed. So we would use S93.492A (sprain of other ligament of left ankle). We’re using a “not elsewhere classified code”, not a “not otherwise specified” code. We have the information, we just don’t have a specific enough code.\r\n\r\nSo that leaves us with Marina’s dislocated left wrist. Dr. Honeydew’s initial documentation leaves something to be desired, like the actual bone Marina dislocated. However, Dr. Honeydew redeemed himself with his comments on the radiology report. According to his notes, “X-ray confirms subluxation of midcarpal joint of left wrist.” We can code S63.032A because Dr. Honeydew documented the injury in his notes.\r\n\r\nWe can also add some additional codes to specify where Marina was and how she suffered her accident.\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Y92.213, high school as the place of occurrence of the external cause (because the notes specify the graduation was held at the high school)</li>\r\n	<li>W10.8XXA, fall (on) (from) other stairs and steps</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nMrs. Forman also made a visit to Fix ‘Em Up after graduation. She passed out during the ceremonies after sitting in the sun for several hours. (Anytown graduated a big class).\r\n\r\nSo did she suffer simply a fainting spell (R55) or did she suffer from heat exhaustion instead (T67.1)? Let’s look at the documentation. Dr. Honeydew wrote:\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>41-year-old female, seen for initial treatment of syncope. Patient states she was sitting in the sun for three hours, then blacked out. Had nothing to drink during that time. Body temperature 105 degrees when first brought in. Determined patient suffered from heat syncope and mild dehydration. Advised her to stay out of the sun and remain hydrated.</em></p>\r\nBased on this note, we would code T67.1XXA (heat syncope) and E86.0 (dehydration). Not that Dr. Honeydew does not mention where Mrs. Forman was when she fainted, so we can’t added Y92.213 unless we send a query.\r\n\r\nRalph Malph also came into the clinic with a graduation-related injury. After the ceremony, members of the Class of 2012 threw their caps in the air (a practice frowned upon by the school district) and Ralph took a mortar board to the right eye.\r\n\r\nDr. Honeydew documents an initial visit for a corneal abrasion with no foreign object and a contusion of the right eye. We would code:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S05.01XA, injury of conjunctiva and corneal abrasion without foreign body, right eye, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S05.11XA, contusion of eyeball and orbital tissues, right eye, initial encounter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBecause the notes don’t say where the injuries took place, we can’t add additional codes.\r\n\r\nAnd with that the Class of 2012 bids a fond farewell to Anytown High School and (we hope) the Fix ‘Em Up Clinic.',

		'body' : 'The ICD-10-CM makes a distinction between burns and corrosions. The burn codes are for thermal burns, except sunburns, that come from a heat source, such as a fire or hot appliance. You also report e burn codes when electricity or radiation caused the burn.\r\n\r\nCorrosions are burns due to chemicals. The guidelines are the same for burns and corrosions.\r\n\r\nCurrent burns (T20-T25) are classified by depth, extent ,and agent (X code). Burns are classified by depth as first degree (erythema), second degree (blistering), and third degree (full-thickness involvement). Burns of the eye and internal organs (T26-T28) are classified by site, but not by degree.\r\n\r\nCoders also need to append the appropriate seventh character to specify the encounter when coding for burns and corrosions:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>A, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>D, subsequent encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S,  sequel</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBe sure to check for code first and code additional notes. For example, a note under the code series T21.0 (burn of unspecified degree of trunk) instructs coders to use additional external cause code to identify the source, place and intent of the burn (X00-X19, X75-X77, X96-X98, Y92).\r\n\r\nFor T20.5 (corrosion of first degree of head, face, and neck), the note specifies: Code first (T51-T65) to identify chemical and intent.\r\n\r\nIf a patient suffers multiple burns, code the most severe burn first. For example, a patient comes in for initial treatment for third degree burns of the neck and first degree burns of the upper left arm. You would report:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>T20.37XA, burn of third degree of neck</li>\r\n	<li>T22.132A, burn of first degree of left upper arm</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nDon’t forget to use additional external cause code to identify the source, place, and intent of the burn (X00-X19, X75-X77, X96-X98, Y92).\r\n\r\nWhen a patient has both internal and external burns, you will select the principal diagnosis or first-listed diagnosis based on the circumstances of admission.\r\n\r\nWhen a patient is admitted for burn injuries and other related conditions such as smoke inhalation and/or respiratory failure, select the principal diagnosis or first-listed diagnosis based on the circumstances of admission.',

Dr. Spock gives Saskia a thorough once-over and finds she’s pretty healthy. He documents a routine health exam with no abnormal findings. In order to code for the visit, we need to know how old Saskia is. When we check Saskia’s chart, we learn she’s just 23 days old. We also find out she was three weeks early, so a clean bill of health should ease Mom’s mind.\r\n\r\nSince Saskia is under 29 days old, we would code Z00.111 (health examination for newborn 8 to 28 days old).\r\n\r\nDr. Spock notices that although Saskia is healthy, Sativa seems irritable and keeps yawning. Since he didn\'t have to spend a lot of time with Saskia, he decides to squeeze Sativa in for a quick clinic visit as well.\r\n\r\nTurns out, Sativa is somewhat sleep deprived because she is feeding Saskia every three or four hours. Dr. Spock diagnoses her with sleep deprivation (Z72.820). Note that sleep deprivation is different from insomnia and code Z72.820 has an Excludes1 note for insomnia. Dr. Spock advised Sativa to let her husband Scott take over some of Saskia’s feedings so Sativa can get some sleep. I’m sure Dad will be only too happy to help (especially if feedings also require diaper changes).\r\n\r\nDr. Spock also sees 14-month-old Oscar and his mom Shannon. Dr. Spock gives Oscar a complete workup since Shannon reports Oscar has been somewhat cranky. Dr. Spock documents a low-grade fever and an ear infection. That explains the crankiness.\r\n\r\nSo what do we code? First, let’s start with Oscar’s checkup. He came in with no specific health problems, so we report a routine health examination. That still gives us two code choices:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Z00.121, encounter for routine child health examination with abnormal findings</li>\r\n	<li>Z00.129, encounter for routine child health examination without abnormal findings</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSince Dr. Spock documented an ear infection and mild fever, we’ll go with Z00.121. But we aren’t done yet. Code Z00.121 includes a note to use additional code to identify abnormal findings. So we also have to code what’s wrong with Oscar. That makes sense.\r\n\r\nWhen we look up fever in the ICD-10-CM alphabetic index, we find more than a full page of possible fever types. We definitely need more information from Dr. Spock. We might be tempted to assume the fever is a result of the each infection, but Dr. Spock didn’t document it as such, so we need to query. A fever is a common symptom of an ear infections (at least according to the Mayo Clinic), but we still need Dr. Spock to say the infection caused the fever. For all we know, Oscar could have picked up some other bug. And wouldn’t that make Shannon so happy?\r\n\r\nWe also need additional information to code the ear infection. Is it acute or chronic? Where is the infection located—outer, middle, or inner ear? Also which side? Is it suppurative or nonsuppurative? Did an allergy cause it?\r\n\r\nTurns out, our fears about finding the correct fever code are unfounded. Dr. Spock responds to our query by stating the fever is a symptom of the infection. The <em>Official ICD-10-CM Guidelines for Coding and Reporting</em> instruct us not to report signs and symptoms routinely associated with a disease process, unless otherwise instructed by the classification. Since Dr. Spock specifically states the fever is a symptom, we wouldn’t code it.\r\n\r\nWhat about the ear infection? Dr. Spock classifies it as an acute middle ear infection. Okay, so we look up infection, ear, and find a note telling us to see also <em>Otitis Media</em>. So off to Otitis Media we go. The first thing we notice is otitis media is not the actual main listing, it’s otitis (acute). The second thing we notice is otitis includes almost two full columns of codes. Yikes!\r\n\r\nBut it’s not as bad as it first appears. First of all, not all of the codes are for otitis media. The listing also includes otitis externa (outer ear). Also many of the listing refer back to other types of otitis media. For example, if you look under acute, subacute H66.90, you’ll find:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>allergic —see Otitis, media, nonsuppurative, acute, allergic</li>\r\n	<li>exudative —see Otitis, media, nonsuppurative, acute</li>\r\n	<li>mucoid —see Otitis, media, nonsuppurative, acute</li>\r\n	<li>necrotizing —see also Otitis, media, suppurative, acute</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSo four different terms all go back to the same listing. Okay, not so bad, but we still need information from Dr. Spock. Fortunately Dr. Spock tells us Oscar suffers from acute serous otitis media in his right ear, H65.01.\r\n\r\nDr. Spock’s final patient for the day is 6-year-old Kit, who suffers from asthma. Her mom brought her in for a check-up and a medication refill. Again, ICD-10-CM offers lots of choices for asthma. The category asthma (J45.-) includes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>allergic (predominantly) asthma</li>\r\n	<li>allergic bronchitis NOS</li>\r\n	<li>allergic rhinitis with asthma</li>\r\n	<li>atopic asthma</li>\r\n	<li>extrinsic allergic asthma</li>\r\n	<li>hay fever with asthma</li>\r\n	<li>idiosyncratic asthma</li>\r\n	<li>intrinsic nonallergic asthma</li>\r\n	<li>nonallergic asthma</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe also need use additional code(s) to identify:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (Z77.22)</li>\r\n	<li>exposure to tobacco smoke in the perinatal period (P96.81)</li>\r\n	<li>history of tobacco use (Z87.891)</li>\r\n	<li>occupational exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (Z57.31)</li>\r\n	<li>tobacco dependence (F17.-)</li>\r\n	<li>tobacco use (Z72.0)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAsthma also features both types of Exludes notes:\r\n\r\nExcludes1:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>detergent asthma (J69.8)</li>\r\n	<li>eosinophilic asthma (J82)</li>\r\n	<li>lung diseases due to external agents (J60-J70)</li>\r\n	<li>miner\'s asthma (J60)</li>\r\n	<li>wheezing NOS (R06.2)</li>\r\n	<li>wood asthma (J67.8)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nExcludes2:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>asthma with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (J44.9)</li>\r\n	<li>chronic asthmatic (obstructive) bronchitis (J44.9)</li>\r\n	<li>chronic obstructive asthma (J44.9)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nRemember that an Exludes1 note means the condition is not coded here. An Excludes1 note indicates that the code excluded should never be reported with the code above the Excludes1 note.\r\n\r\nAn Excludes2 note means ”not included here.” An Excludes2 note means that the condition excluded is not part of the condition under which it is listed, but a patient may have both conditions at the same time.\r\n\r\nSo what type of asthma does Kit have? Asthma is divided into:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Mild intermittent</li>\r\n	<li>Mild persistent</li>\r\n	<li>Moderate persistent</li>\r\n	<li>Severe persistent</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nFortunately for Kit, Dr. Spock documents uncomplicated mild intermittent asthma . He does not document any symptoms at this time and does not document status asthmaticus. So we would report:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Z00.121, encounter for routine child health examination with abnormal findings</li>\r\n	<li>J45.20, mild intermittent asthma, uncomplicated</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAnd with that, the last child exists the Fix ‘Em Up Clinic and blessed silence reigns. Until some cranky adult appears, of course.',

Which eye is involved—right, left, or both?\r\n\r\nIf our physician documents an age related cataract of the right eye, we still have the following general categories:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>H25.0, age-related incipient cataract</li>\r\n	<li>H25.1, age-related nuclear cataract</li>\r\n	<li>H25.2, age-related cataract, morgagnian type</li>\r\n	<li>H25.8, other age-related cataract</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nOur physician states the cataract is an age-related incipient cataract of the right eye. We still have four possible code choices, so we need even more specific information :\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>H25.011, cortical age-related cataract, right eye</li>\r\n	<li>H25.031, anterior subcapsular polar age-related cataract, right eye</li>\r\n	<li>H25.041, posterior subcapsular polar age-related cataract, right eye</li>\r\n	<li>H25.091, other age-related incipient cataract, right eye</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nICD-10-CM devotes an entire chapter (Chapter 7 for those keeping score at home) to just diseases of the eye and adnexa (the accessory visual structures). In ICD-9-CM, the eyes and ears share a chapter.\r\n\r\nNote that you use different codes to report cataracts in diseases classified elsewhere. When reporting H28 (cataract in diseases classified elsewhere), code first underlying disease, such as:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>hypoparathyroidism (E20.-)</li>\r\n	<li>myotonia (G71.1-)</li>\r\n	<li>myxedema (E03.-)</li>\r\n	<li>protein-calorie malnutrition (E40-E46)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou’ll also find the following note: Excludes1: cataract in diabetes mellitus (E08.33, E09.33, E10.33, E11.33, E13.33).\r\n\r\nWhen a patient comes in with an injury to the eye, and not a disease of the eye, you’ll need to look elsewhere in the ICD-10-CM manual for the correct code. For example, a patient comes in with a corneal abrasion. The alphabetic index directs you to series S05 (injury of eye and orbit). Notice that this code series requires a seventh character to denote the encounter as initial (A), subsequent (D), or sequela (S). Not all of the codes have six other characters, so be sure to add X as a placeholder when necessary.\r\n\r\nIf our patient suffered a corneal abrasion without a foreign body, we still need to know which eye was injured. ICD-10-CM does include a code for unspecified eye, but avoid using it whenever possible (even if that means querying the physician). The code may exist, but that doesn’t mean you’ll get paid. An insurance company could argue that unspecified eye is too vague and really, the physician should know which eye was involved.\r\n\r\nIf your physicians don’t consistently document laterality now, start working with them to get them in the habit of stating a side. You don’t always need that information to select an ICD-9-CM code, but if they start documenting it now, they’ll do when we switch to ICD-10-CM. And your life as a coder will be easier.\r\n\r\nOur physician is an excellent documenter (after we badger him for information), so we know he saw the patient for a subsequent visit for a left corneal abrasion without foreign body—S05.02XD.\r\n\r\nMaybe our patient is very unlucky and suffers a corrosive burn to the eye. You’ll find those codes in the T26 series (burns and corrosion confined to eye and adnexa). Again, you’ll need to add the appropriate seventh character (A, D, or S) to your code.\r\n\r\nYou also need to know whether the patient suffered a burn or a corrosive injury, what specific part of the eye or adnexa was involved, as well as which eye. Burn coding also generally requires additional codes, so be sure to read all of the notes within the numeric index.\r\n\r\nIf our patient suffered a burn with resulting rupture and destruction of right eyeball and is seen for an initial visit, report T26.21XA. A note under T26.2 reminds us to use additional external cause code to identify the source, place and intent of the burn (X00-X19, X75-X77,X96-X98, Y92).\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if the patient is seen for an initial visit with corrosion of cornea and conjunctival sac of the right eye, report T26.61XA. For codes under T26.6, we have the following two notes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Code first (T51-T65) to identify chemical and intent</li>\r\n	<li>Use additional external cause code to identify place (Y92)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSo you need to pay attention not only to the code requirements, but to the notes around the code as well. And that, of course, is nothing new. We already do it for ICD-9-CM coding.\r\n\r\nNow, if you’ll excuse me, I feel a sudden urge to find a really strong pair of sunglasses … or maybe a welder’s mask to protect my eyes.',

Well, you’re in luck. ICD-10-CM has plenty of codes for reporting that headache.\r\n\r\nIn order to code for a headache, we first need to know what kind of headache it is. For example, you may have a tension headache caused by studying ICD-10-CM. In order to code for that tension headache, we need to know whether it is episodic, chronic, or unspecified.\r\n\r\nWe also need to know whether it is intractable or not intractable. Intractable pain is pain that has no significant chance of being altered by usual treatment modalities or natural healing. The provider must document whether the pain is intractable or not. Don’t assume based on treatment.\r\n\r\nIf your physician documents chronic tension-type headache, intractable, report G44.221. The headache codes do not require a seventh character to denote the encounter, unlike codes for fractures.\r\n\r\nMaybe instead of a tension headache, you are suffering from a post-traumatic headache. For these headaches, we need to know whether it is acute, chronic, or unspecified, intractable or not intractable. Report code G44.319 for an acute, not intractable post-traumatic headache.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you are actually suffering from a cluster headache, which falls under category G44.0 (Cluster headaches and other trigeminal autonomic cephalgias [TAC]).\r\n\r\nCluster headache codes include codes for episodic, chronic, or unspecified cluster headaches, as well as episodic and chronic paroxysmal hemicranias, short lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache, and other trigeminal autonomic cephalgias.\r\n\r\nSo if the physician documents “cluster headache” query for more information. Also be sure to ask whether the pain is intractable or not so you can select the appropriate sixth character.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you have a drug-induced headache from taking too many aspirin to relieve your ICD-10-CM induced headache. You only have two choices for this type of headache, but it’s worth looking at the entire entry because it does include an important note:\r\n\r\n<strong>G44.4, Drug-induced headache, not elsewhere classified</strong>\r\n\r\nMedication overuse headache\r\n\r\nUse additional code for adverse effect, if applicable, to identify drug (T36-T50 with fifth or sixth character 5)\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">G44.40, Drug-induced headache, not elsewhere classified, not intractable</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">G44.41, Drug-induced headache, not elsewhere classified, intractable</p>\r\nICD-10-CM does include codes for other specified headache syndromes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>G44.81, hypnic headache</li>\r\n	<li>G44.82, headache associated with sexual activity</li>\r\n	<li>G44.83, primary cough headache</li>\r\n	<li>G44.84, primary exertional headache</li>\r\n	<li>G44.85, primary stabbing headache</li>\r\n	<li>G44.89, other headache syndrome</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThat’s a lot of different types of headaches and we haven’t even talked about migraines yet.

She tells Dr. McSteamy that she was outside working in her garden for several hours before she started to feel sick.\r\n\r\nHer symptoms could be either heat exhaustion or heatstroke. Either way, we’re heading to the T67 series of codes (effects of heat and light). Now we just need a clinical diagnosis.\r\n\r\nIn his notes, Dr. McSteamy notes that despite the heat, Meredith is not sweating and her core body temperature is 106 degrees. That leads him to diagnose heatstroke. That leads us to code T67.0, heatstroke and sunstroke. But wait, we aren’t done yet. T67.0 isn’t a valid code. The <em>ICD-10-CM Manual</em> tells us to check the seventh character for T67.0, which means we need to know what encounter this is: initial, subsequent, or sequela.\r\n\r\nFortunately, Dr. McSteamy noted that he was seeing Meredith for an initial visit, so we would report T67.0XXA.\r\n\r\nWe also need to look for any complications because T67.0 includes this note:\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Use additional code(s) to identify any associated complications of heatstroke, such as:</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">coma and stupor (R40.-)</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">systemic inflammatory response syndrome (R65.1-)</p>\r\nBack to Dr. McSteamy’s notes.  As part of his final diagnosis, he noted heatstroke with no complications. So no additional codes.\r\n\r\nDr. McSteamy’s second patient, Derek, is suffering many of the same symptoms as Meredith: headache, nausea, and dizziness. However, Derek is sweating profusely. That leads Dr. McSteamy to diagnosis heat exhaustion. He also notes that Derek is mildly dehydrated.\r\n\r\nThis should be easy, right? Well, not quite. ICD-10-CM includes three codes for heat exhaustion:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>T67.3, Heat exhaustion, anhydrotic</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Heat prostration due to water depletion</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Excludes1: heat exhaustion due to salt depletion (T67.4)</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>T67.4, heat exhaustion due to salt depletion</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Heat prostration due to salt (and water) depletion</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>T67.5, Heat exhaustion, unspecified</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSadly Dr. McSteamy did not include that information in his documentation, so we need to query him. And while we’re at it, we’ll ask for the encounter level as well so we can assign the appropriate seventh character.\r\n\r\nIn response to our very polite and non-leading query, Dr. McSteamy diagnoses Derek with anhydrotic heat exhaustion and notes this is an initial encounter. For this case, we would code:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>T67.3XXA, Heat exhaustion, anhydrotic</li>\r\n	<li>E86.0, Dehydration</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nNotice that dehydration doesn’t require a seventh character.\r\n\r\nNext into the clinic is Owen, who comes is with a sunburn. He was playing beach volleyball and forgot his sunscreen. Now his back is burned in a bad way. He also sprained his ankle. Dr. McSteamy diagnoses third-degree sunburn and a sprained left ankle.\r\n\r\nThe sunburn codes in ICD-10-CM are pretty simple—all you need to know is the degree of the burn. So in this case we would report L55.2 (sunburn of third degree).\r\n\r\nThe ankle sprain isn’t so easy. We need to know which ankle Owen sprained (Dr. McSteamy noted the left). We also need to know which ligament or ligaments Owen injured. That Dr. McSteamy did not document. Finally we need to know the encounter, which is also not in the documentation. Time to query!\r\n\r\nIn response, Dr. McSteamy documents initial encounter, sprain of deltoid ligament, left ankle. So we would report S93.422A.\r\n\r\nWe also know some other information about Owen that we can also code, such as where his injury took place and what he was doing. So we can assign:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Y92.832, beach as the place of occurrence of the external cause</li>\r\n	<li>Y93.68, activity, volleyball (beach) (court)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nDr. McSteamy’s final patient Lexie decided to work on her training for the Boston Marathon in the middle of a heat wave. Well, temperatures for this year’s marathon were pretty high, so maybe it makes sense. Or not, since Lexie ended up with painful spasms of her arms and abdomen.\r\n\r\nAfter examining Lexie, Dr. McSteamy diagnosis heat cramps and documents an initial visit. That leads us to code T67.2XXA.\r\n\r\nLexie is our last patient of the day, so I am heading out to enjoy the sunshine….from the shade, with plenty of water!',

Status epilepticus is a serious medical condition where prolonged or clustered seizures develop into non-stop seizures, according to the Epilepsy Foundation.\r\n\r\nAs a result, each ICD-9-CM code doesn’t map to a single ICD-10-CM.\r\n\r\nConsider a patient with localization-related (focal) (partial) epilepsy and epileptic syndromes with complex partial seizures, without mention of intractable epilepsy. In ICD-9-CM, you would report 345.40. When you convert that code to ICD-10-CM, you come up with two possible replacements:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>G40.201, localization-related (focal) (partial) symptomatic epilepsy and epileptic syndromes with complex partial seizures, not intractable, with status epilepticus</li>\r\n	<li>G40.209, localization-related (focal) (partial) symptomatic epilepsy and epileptic syndromes with complex partial seizures, not intractable, without status epilepticus</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIf your physicians currently don’t note with or without status epilepticus, start asking for it now. That way by the time we get to ICD-10-CM, they will be in the habit of documenting that information.\r\n\r\nAlso note a slight difference in wording that will also impact documentation. In ICD-9-CM, you report the fifth digit 0 if the physician does not document intractable epilepsy. So the patient could have intractable epilepsy, the physician just didn’t specify one way or the other.\r\n\r\nWhen you read the ICD-10-CM code descriptions, you’ll notice they read “intractable” or “not intractable” so the physician is going to document one or the other. Again, if physicians aren’t documenting it now, start asking them for the information.\r\n\r\nTwo other things to note under the general heading of G40:\r\n\r\n<strong>Note:</strong> the following terms are to be considered equivalent to intractable: pharmacoresistant (pharmacologicallyresistant), treatment resistant, refractory (medically), and poorly controlled\r\n\r\n<strong>Excludes1:</strong>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">conversion disorder with seizures (F44.5)</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">convulsions NOS (R56.9)</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">hippocampal sclerosis (G93.81)</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">mesial temporal sclerosis (G93.81)</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">post traumatic seizures (R56.1)</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">seizure (convulsive) NOS (R56.9)</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">seizure of newborn (P90)</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">temporal sclerosis (G93.81)</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Todd\'s paralysis (G83.8)</p>\r\nAn Excludes1 note means he condition is not coded here.

While he was grilling dinner, one of the tomatoes made a break for it, rolling off the grill and onto the patio of Matt’s single-family home.\r\n\r\nMatt saw it go, considered it a goner, and went back to grilling. The tomato was not prepared to be ignored. It strategically placed itself under Matt’s left sandal. He stepped down and felt “flaming tomato napalm” squirt between his foot and his sandal. When he looked down to verify that the tomato had taken its revenge, he smacked his head into the grill, giving himself a mild concussion and opening a 3-inch gash on his forehead.\r\n\r\nWhen he put his hand up to stem the flow of blood from his forehead, he dropped his grilling fork—straight into the top of his right foot.\r\n\r\nAfter uttering a few choice phrases on the nature of cherry tomato terrorism, Matt arrived at Fix ‘Em Up Clinic for repairs.\r\n\r\nSo how would we report his multiple injuries? We don’t really have sequencing guidelines for ICD-10-CM that tell us which injury to code first, so let’s look at the injuries in the order Matt sustained them.\r\n\r\nWe know Matt’s burn is to the left foot, which takes us to ICD-10-CM code series T25 (burn and corrosion of ankle and foot). The first thing we notice is the entire series of codes needs a seventh character to specify the encounter—initial, subsequent, or sequela. We look to Dr. Tom A. Toe’s documentation and see that this is Matt’s first visit.\r\n\r\nThe next thing we need to know is the degree of the burn—first, second, third, or unspecified. Try to avoid unspecified even if you need to query. We also need to know where specifically the burn is—ankle, foot, toes, or multiple sites. Back to the documentation, when Dr. Toe has documented a second degree burn to the bottom of the foot. That leads us to T25.222A, burn of second degree of left foot.\r\n\r\nBut we aren’t done with this injury yet. Under T25.2 (burn of second degree of ankle and foot) we find this note: Use additional external cause code to identify the source, place, and intent of the burn (X00-X19, X75-X77,X96-X98, Y92). Fortunately, we have that information in our narrative of the accident:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>X12.XXXA, contact with other hot fluids (the liquid inside the tomato)</li>\r\n	<li>Y92.018, other place in single-family (private) house as the place of occurrence of the external cause</li>\r\n	<li>Y93.G2, activity, grilling and smoking food</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nICD-10-CM does not specify a patio as a place of occurrence (hence Y92.018), but does include a code for garden or yard. Since we don’t know where the patio is located (and it’s a patio, not the garden or yard), we’ll go with other place. “Other place” is not the same as “unspecified place.” We know where specifically Matt suffered his injuries, we just don’t have a code for it.\r\n\r\nThat takes us to Matt’s concussion and forehead laceration. Dr. Toe documented no loss of consciousness, so we would report S06.0X0A (concussion without loss of consciousness, initial encounter).\r\n\r\nFor the laceration, we need to know whether Matt had any foreign body in the wound (a check of the documentation says, no). When we look up laceration, forehead in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index, we are directed to S01.81, laceration without foreign body of other part of head. When we go to the Tabular Index, we see that we need a seventh character to denote the encounter type, so our final code would be S01.81XA.\r\n\r\nThat brings us to Matt’s final injury, the fork to the foot. Matt removed the fork before coming to Fix ‘Em Up, and fortunately, nothing stayed behind in the punctures. Again, we need to know which foot (right), with or without foreign body (without), foot itself or toes (foot itself), and encounter type (initial). All of that brings us to: S91.331A (puncture wound without foreign body, right foot, initial encounter).\r\n\r\nAnd with that, Dr. Toe is done with Matt and we are done with his diagnostic record. So it’s time to head home and fire up the grill. I will not be adding any cherry tomatoes though.',

		'body' : 'Why hello there, Mr. Coyote. Long time, no see. Are you still chasing that roadrunner? You are? Well, you are certainly persistent, I’ll give you that. So what brings you into the Acme Clinic today? You’re <a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Coyote-21.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-2908\" title=\"Coyote 2\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Coyote-21.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"229\" height=\"213\" /></a>here to see Dr. Frankenbean for a follow up? Certainly, have a seat and we’ll be right with you.\r\n\r\nPoor Wile E. I got the whole story from his medical record when I was coding his chart. Apparently, he ordered a do-it-yourself tornado kit (designed to seed clouds) from a less-than reputable dealer. Unfortunately, the seeds got wet before Wile E. could disperse them properly and they created a massive tornado. Of course instead of scooping up that evil bird, the tornado took Wile E. on a ride to an abandoned mine field, then dropped him. Our poor coyote friend suffered multiple injuries that Dr. Frankebean treated at the Acme ED three weeks ago and now he’s back for a progress check.\r\n\r\nAccording to Dr. Frankenbean’s notes, Wile E. suffered a:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Subluxation of the cervical vertebrae (that explains the neck brace)</li>\r\n	<li>Primary blast injury to the lung (caused by the mines exploding)</li>\r\n	<li>Traumatic rupture of ear drum due to blast injury (also caused by the mines exploding)</li>\r\n	<li>Singed fur</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nLuckily for Wile E., he is healing well, according to the chart.\r\n\r\nSo how do we code all of Wile E.’s various injuries? One thing we need to know for most of the codes is the encounter type. We know this is not an initial visit. Wile E. saw the same physician for the same injuries three weeks ago. That leaves us with subsequent (D) or sequela (S). How do we know whether to use a D or an S as our seventh character?\r\n\r\nIn Dr. Frankenbean’s notes, he documented a follow up visit, but does not mention any late effects of the injuries. That means we’re coding for a subsequent visit.\r\n\r\nLet’s start with the subluxation of the cervical vertebrae. We know it’s a subluxation, not a fracture, in the cervical area, and a subsequent visit. What else do we need to know? How about the specific vertebrae involved? ICD-10-CM does include a code for unspecified vertebra, but we want to avoid reporting that code if we can. So let’s see if the information is in Wile E.’s medical record. And it is. Dr. Frankenbean notes, “CT scan shows improvement in subluxation at C2/3 and 3/4.” So we would report:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S13.130D, subluxation of C2/C3 cervical vertebrae, subsequent visit</li>\r\n	<li>S13.140D, subluxation of C3/C4 cervical vertebrae, subsequent visit</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nMake sure you check the notes at the top of the S13 (dislocation and sprain of joints and ligaments at neck level) series of codes. We have includes, code also, and Excludes2 notes to follow. None of those notes apply for our case, but you should always check them to be sure.\r\n\r\nBy looking back to the beginning of the series, we also find the notation to report the appropriate seventh character. If you just look at the specific codes for subluxation of the cervical vertebrae, you might miss the seventh character and then your code’s not valid and you don’t get paid. Bad stuff.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of bad stuff, let’s move on to Wile E.’s blast injury. We know which organ was affected (lung) and we know subsequent visit. What we don’t see at first is the laterality. And the laterality here is a little different from the laterality of other codes. Here we just need to know unilateral, bilateral, or unspecified. We don’t need to know right or left. So back to the documentation where we find Wile E. suffered a blast injury of the right lung. That means unilateral, which leads to code:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S27.311D, primary blast injury of lung, unilateral, subsequent visit</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nFor the traumatic blast injury to the ear, again we need to know whether it’s unilateral, bilateral, or unspecified. In the record, we see that Dr. Frankenbean called in an audiologist, Dr. Ringer, to see Wile E. during the visit. In her note, she states that the blast ruptured both of Wile E.’s ear drums, which means bilateral.\r\n\r\nShe also notes that she also consulted during Wile E.’s initial visit. So we are still coding a subsequent encounter. The seventh character A is for use as long as the patient is receiving active treatment for the fracture, according to the <em>ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines</em>. Active treatment includes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Surgical treatment</li>\r\n	<li>Emergency department encounter</li>\r\n	<li>Evaluation and treatment by a new physician</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAccording to the guidelines, we use the seventh character D for encounters after the patient has completed active treatment. So, same physician, follow up, no sequela, bilateral ears leads us to:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S09.313D, primary blast injury of ear, bilateral, subsequent visit</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nICD-10-CM does not include a code for singed fur (not surprising since most people don’t have fur). However, it does include an extensive list of burn codes. Could the singed fur actually be a burn? It’s possible, but according to Dr. Frankenbean’s original notes, “fur burned off of face, but no burns to the tissue.” So no burn code for Wile E.\r\n\r\nAnd as a friend of Wile E’s would say, “That’s all, folks!”',

We’re not sure exactly what Jimmy drank, largely because Jimmy’s not sure.\r\n\r\nWhat we do know is Jimmy is suffering from acute alcohol intoxication without complications. Dr. Bender has ruled out alcohol poisoning, a very serious condition, and instead determined that Jimmy’s symptoms are the result of alcohol intoxication.\r\n\r\nWhen we look up alcohol related disorders, we find a variety of potential codes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>F10.1, alcohol abuse</li>\r\n	<li>F10.2, alcohol dependence</li>\r\n	<li>F10.9, alcohol use, unspecified</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nHow do we determine which code series to use? By reading the documentation of course. Here’s what Dr. Bender has to say about Jimmy’s alcohol use:\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Patient reports history of occasional social drinking, rarely drinks to excess. Was out celebrating upcoming wedding, had too much to drink. No finding of chronic abuse or dependence.</em></p>\r\nNo abuse or dependence means we’ll use the unspecified code. Even knowing that, we still have plenty of codes to choose from, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>F10.92, alcohol use, unspecified with intoxication</li>\r\n	<li>F10.94, alcohol use, unspecified with alcohol-induced mood disorder</li>\r\n	<li>F10.95, alcohol use, unspecified with alcohol-induced psychotic disorder</li>\r\n	<li>F10.96, alcohol use, unspecified with alcohol-induced persisting amnestic disorder</li>\r\n	<li>F10.97, alcohol use, unspecified with alcohol-induced persisting dementia</li>\r\n	<li>F10.98, alcohol use, unspecified with other alcohol-induced disorders</li>\r\n	<li>F10.99, alcohol use, unspecified with unspecified alcohol-induced disorder</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIf we go back to the documentation, we see a notation of “without complications” so we’ll report:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>F10.920, alcohol use, unspecified with intoxication, uncomplicated</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nJimmy got off pretty lucky (until his fiancée finds out what he was doing in Atlantic City), but some of his friends ended up with more than just a hangover.\r\n\r\nChris not only overindulged in alcohol, but ended up walking into a lamppost while walking on Baltic Avenue. That collision left him with a concussion, broken nose, and two black eyes. Fortunately, the effects of the alcohol had not worn off, so he didn’t feel a thing.\r\n\r\nWe can report Chris’ overindulgence with F10.920 because Dr. Bender noted only impaired coordination and slurred speech as problems related to the alcohol. Those are really more consequences of too many beers and not complications.\r\n\r\nIn order to code Chris’ concussion, we need to know if he lost consciousness. His friends report a brief loss of consciousness. When pressed for a more specific time frame, Jimmy says, five or 10 minutes.\r\n\r\nThat leads us to S06.0X1, concussion with loss of consciousness of 30 minutes or less, but we’re not done yet. Codes in the S06 series require a seventh character to denote the encounter type. Dr. Bender documented an initial encounter for all of Chris’ injuries, so the final code is\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S06.0X1A, concussion with loss of consciousness of 30 minutes or less, initial visit</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nChris’ broken nose is easy to code because he only has one nose (no laterality) and we already know the encounter type (initial). That leads to code:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S02.2xxA, fracture of nasal bones, initial visit</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nNote that you do need to add two “x” placeholders to make sure the seventh character ends up in the seventh place. S02.2A is not a valid code.\r\n\r\nThat leaves Chris’ two black eyes. Since Chris managed to get two black eyes, we need to report two codes, again adding the seventh character for the encounter:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S00.11xA, contusion of right eyelid and periocular area, initial visit</li>\r\n	<li>S00.12xA, contusion of left eyelid and periocular area, initial visit</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe can also add codes to explain how Chris suffered his injuries:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>W22.02xA, walked into lamppost, initial visit</li>\r\n	<li>Y92.480, sidewalk as the place of occurrence of the external cause</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAnd that brings us to Dan, the final member of the party. Dan was having so much fun at the bar that he didn’t want to leave. When the bouncers tried to escort him out, Dan put up a fight. Dr. Bender noted the following:\r\n\r\n<em>Patient seen for initial visit following drunken unarmed altercation in restaurant bar. No complications from alcohol. Patient sustained laceration to left cheekbone, abrasions to right knuckles, multiple broken ribs left side, and abdominal contusions. No internal injuries. No foreign bodies in any of the wounds.</em>\r\n\r\nKind of makes you wonder how the other guys look. But since we don’t have to code their injuries, let’s focus on Dan.\r\n\r\nDan also gets F10.920 for his overindulgence. One down, many codes to go.\r\n\r\nNext is his lacerated cheekbone. We know which side (left), which encounter type (initial), and no foreign bodies. That takes us to code:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S01.412A, laceration without foreign body of left cheek and temporomandibular area, initial visit</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nMoving on to the abrasions on his right knuckles, we run into a problem. ICD-10-CM contains a separate code for abrasion of each finger. And Dr. Bender didn’t specify. He gave us which hand, but not which fingers. So we’ll have to query.\r\n\r\nDr. Bender adds the following information in response to our query: Abrasions of right index, middle, ring fingers, no fractures.\r\n\r\nThree fingers means three codes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S60.410A, abrasion of right index finger, initial visit</li>\r\n	<li>S60.412A, abrasion of right middle finger, initial visit</li>\r\n	<li>S60.414A, abrasion of right ring finger</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nNext up, broken ribs. I hope we don’t have to know which ones! And it turns out, we don’t, we just need to know that more than one is broken and which side (left). That gives us:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S22.42xA, multiple fractures of ribs, left side, initial visit</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe code for abdominal contusions is even less specific: S30.1xxA (contusion of abdominal wall, initial visit).\r\n\r\nWe can also add:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Y04.0xxA, assault by unarmed brawl or fight, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>Y92.511, restaurant or café as the place of occurrence of the external cause</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWell, let’s hope things go more smoothly for Jimmy and his friends in the fut',

Comments were due within 30 days of publication.\r\n\r\nThat was more than two months ago.

Don’t use HHS’ drawn out process as an excuse to stop preparing. CMS released a checklist to use in preparing for ICD-10. The steps include:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Educate staff and leadership about ICD-10</li>\r\n	<li>Perform an impact assessment</li>\r\n	<li>Plan a realistic and comprehensive budget</li>\r\n	<li>Coordinate with external partners</li>\r\n	<li>Get ready for testing</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nMost facilities and practices should have already completed at least the first three steps. After all, until April, we were expecting ICD-10 implementation to be in 2013. Who knows, it could still be 2013. Just because HHS proposed delaying implementation doesn’t mean it’s going to finalize that plan.\r\n\r\nOne thing that CMS didn’t include on its list is coordinating with internal partners. ICD-10 implementation is going to affect pretty much every part of your organization except housekeeping and maybe the physical plant. Don’t fall into the trap of thinking ICD-10 is only an HIM problem.\r\n\r\nIf you haven’t already created an implementation team, there’s no time like the present. If you have a team in place, make sure it includes the correct members. According to CMS, project teams should consist of representatives from key areas of your organization, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Senior Management</li>\r\n	<li>Health Information Management/Coding</li>\r\n	<li>Billing/Finance</li>\r\n	<li>Compliance</li>\r\n	<li>Revenue Cycle Management</li>\r\n	<li>Information Systems and Technology</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nMake sure you appoint a project or team leader and communicate regular with each other, the staff, and senior management.

		'body' : 'The dogs days of summer have arrived so the residents of Anytown descended on the dog park with their furry friends today. Sadly, not all of the puppies (and people) play well together and some of the ended up at the Fix ‘Em Clinic to see Dr. Huck Hound.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Puppy.png\"><img class=\"alignright  wp-image-2930\" title=\"ICD-10 goes to the dogs\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Puppy-229x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"198\" height=\"259\" /></a>Ilene thought it would be a good idea to take Howie, her Bichon Frisé, to the park so he could frolick to his heart’s content. Unfortunately, as soon as they hit the park, Howie spotted a bunny near the woods and took off in hot pursuit—while Ilene still had a firm grip on his leash. Howie succeeded in wrenching her arm but the bunny made a clean getaway.\r\n\r\nDr. Hound sees Ilene for an initial visit and diagnoses a dislocated right shoulder. That gives us the laterality and the encounter (for our seventh character). What else do we need to know?\r\n\r\nLet’s start with the specific type of dislocation. Is it a dislocation of the acromioclavicular joint, the humerus, or the scapula? Also, is this a recurrent dislocation? Maybe Howie chases bunnies often.\r\n\r\nWhen we scan through Dr. Hound’s notes, we see he documented subluxation of the humerus. Great, so we’re all set. Or maybe not. When we look up the code, we find out that we need to know whether the subluxation is anterior or posterior. Time to query. Dr. Hound informs us that the injury is a posterior subluxation and it not recurrent. That leads us to code:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S43.024A, posterior dislocation of right humerus, initial visit</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSince we know where Ilene was when she was injured, we could also report:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Y92.830, public park as the place of occurrence of the external cause</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBecause she was walking Howie at the time of the incident, we could also add:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Y93.K1, activities involving walking an animal</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nKeep in mind, though, that not all payers want to see external causes codes (think ICD-9 E codes) on the claim. Make sure you know your payer’s preference before you submit the claim.\r\n\r\nShannon also visited the dog park today with her 9-year-old pit bull Damian. Poor Damian, in addition to being an older dog also suffers from lupus. He is content to mainly bask in the sun on a warm patch of grass. That’s great for Shannon until it’s time to go home and Damian doesn’t want to budge. Rather than fight with her dog, Shannon picked him up – and pulled the muscles in her back. Damian apparently packed on the pounds recently.\r\n\r\nDr. Hound documents an initial visit for a lower back strain. That’s pretty easy to code as it turns out:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S39.012A, strain of muscle, fascia and tendon of lower back, initial visit</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAgain, if your payer wants the external causes codes, report Y92.830 for the park. You scould also report:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Y93.K9, overexertion related to animal care</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWhat if Shannon was the patient with lupus instead of Damian? How would we code that condition? Turns out we would need a lot of information. First of all, we need to narrow down the type of lupus:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Anticoagulent</li>\r\n	<li>Discoid</li>\r\n	<li>Erythematosus</li>\r\n	<li>Exedens</li>\r\n	<li>Hydralazine</li>\r\n	<li>Nephritis</li>\r\n	<li>Nontuberculous, not disseminated</li>\r\n	<li>Panniculitis</li>\r\n	<li>Pernio (Besnier)</li>\r\n	<li>Tuberculous</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSo if the physician just documents lupus, that won’t cut it in ICD-10-CM. Let’s say Dr. Hound documents systemic lupus erythematosus. Is that enough to get us to the correct code? Unfortunately not, but you knew I was going to say that, didn’t you?\r\n\r\nCodes for systemic lupus erythematosus fall under the M32 category in ICD-10-CM. Our choices include:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>M32.0, drug-induced systemic lupus erythematosus</li>\r\n	<li>M32.1, systemic lupus erythematosus with organ or system involvement (with multiple subcategories to indicate specific organ or system involvement)</li>\r\n	<li>M32.8, other forms of systemic lupus erythematosus</li>\r\n	<li>M32.9, systemic lupus erythematosus, unspecified</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIf you see a lot of lupus patients in your facility or practice, start getting your physicians used to documenting these additional details now so it will be an habit by the time we start using ICD-10-CM.\r\n\r\nOur final visitor from the dog park is Sally, who had a close encounter with Damian while he was napping. Sally, who’s 5, didn’t see Damian, tripped over him, and went sprawling in the dirt. Damian woke up, looked around, concluded nothing interesting was going on, and promptly went back to sleep.\r\n\r\nSally’s mom took her home thinking Sally suffered no serious injuries, but found out Sally cut her hand on a rock when she fell and part of the rock remained embedded in her hand. So Mom brought Sally in to see Dr. Hound.\r\n\r\nDr. Hound documents an initial visit for a laceration of the right palm with rock fragments still inside. I think he’s getting the hang of this detailed documenting. That tells us everything we need to know. Just as a side note, ICD-10-CM does not include a code for a laceration specifically of the palm. When you look up laceration, palm, in the Alphabetic Index, it directs you to laceration, hand.\r\n\r\nOur codes for Sally would be:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S61.421A, laceration with foreign body of right hand, initial visit</li>\r\n	<li>Y92.830, public park as the place of occurrence of the external cause</li>\r\n	<li>W54.8XXA, other contact with dog, initial encounter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nICD-10-CM includes codes for bitten by and struck by a dog, everything else falls under other contact with dog. Since Sally tripped over Damian, who was napping and minding his own business, we would go with other contact with dog.\r\n\r\nThat’s all for today’s outing to the dog park. The next time you take your puppy for out, make sure you watch where you’re going so you don’t trip over a dog or step in something worse.',

They’re getting their own chapter. In ICD-9-CM, eyes and ears shared a section.\r\n\r\nYou’ll find diseases of the ear in Chapter 8 (H60-H95) in ICD-10-CM. Not surprisingly, that’s right after diseases of the eye and adnexa, which live in Chapter 7. ICD-10-CM divides the diseases of the ear into externa, media, and interna, just like ICD-9-CM.\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM diseases of the ear generally require that you know which ear is involved or if both ears are affected. For example, if a physician documents an abscess of the external ear, coders have four choices:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>H60.00, abscess of external ear, unspecified ear</li>\r\n	<li>H60.01, abscess of right external ear</li>\r\n	<li>H60.02, abscess of left external ear</li>\r\n	<li>H60.03, abscess of external ear, bilateral</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAvoid the unspecified ear code as much as possible. The whole point of going to ICD-10-CM is to gather better, more complete data, so unspecified ear doesn’t really cut it. And the physician should know which ear he or she treated and many physicians are already documenting that information. You may just have to locate it.\r\n\r\nFor some conditions, ICD-10-CM contains more codes, but the only addition is really the laterality. Take a look at otosclerosis. In ICD-9-CM, you have five codes to choose from:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>387.0, otosclerosis involving oval window, nonobliterative</li>\r\n	<li>387.1, otosclerosis involving oval window, obliterative</li>\r\n	<li>387.2, cochlear otosclerosis</li>\r\n	<li>387.8, other otosclerosis</li>\r\n	<li>387.9, otosclerosis, unspecified</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nICD-10-CM contains 20 codes for otosclerosis. However, ICD-10-CM still uses the same five subcategories as ICD-9-CM. The additional codes just provide the detail of where the otosclerosis is located:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Right ear</li>\r\n	<li>Left ear</li>\r\n	<li>Bilateral</li>\r\n	<li>Unspecified</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSo you’ll see a lot more codes, but really only need one additional piece of information.\r\n\r\nAnother common feature of the ear disease codes is “other specified” as a code choice. Just as in ICD-9-CM, other specified means we have detailed information, but we don’t have a code that fits. That’s different from “unspecified,” which means we have the code choices, but not the information.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, coders will see both “other specified” and “unspecified” as choices in the same subcategory. Consider disorders of the acoustic nerve. The subcategory includes the following codes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>H93.8X1, other specified disorders of right ear</li>\r\n	<li>H93.8X2, other specified disorders of left ear</li>\r\n	<li>H93.8X3, other specified disorders of ear, bilateral</li>\r\n	<li>H93.8X9, other specified disorders of ear, unspecified ear</li>\r\n	<li>H93.90, unspecified disorder of ear, unspecified ear</li>\r\n	<li>H93.91, unspecified disorder of right ear</li>\r\n	<li>H93.92, unspecified disorder of left ear</li>\r\n	<li>H93.93, unspecified disorder of ear, bilateral</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIf you find yourself report H93.90, you need to stop and query the physician.  Payers may reimburse you for an unspecified disorder of an unspecified ear immediately after the transition to ICD-10-CM (or they may not). However, as time goes on, you’ll probably have a harder time collecting reimbursement for such a vague diagnosis.',

Just like the pros, though, our players haven’t escaped injury free.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/angry-baseball.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright  wp-image-2951\" title=\"angry baseball\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/angry-baseball-292x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"226\" height=\"232\" /></a>Randy, the league’s top southpaw pitcher, is back to see Dr. Selig for a follow up visit for a rotator cuff injury he suffered earlier in the season after throwing one too many super special fastballs. Dr. Selig documents the following:\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Routine follow up visit for a partial tear of the left supraspinatus tendon caused by overuse. Injury occurred on baseball field during summer league baseball game. Patient is healing well. Will see again in two weeks.</em></p>\r\nWhen we look up supraspinatus tendon in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index, it directs us to M75.10-. Because of that dash at the end of the code in the index, we know we need additional characters to complete our code.\r\n\r\nWhen we look up that code in the Tabular List, we notice ICD-10-CM includes three types of rotator cuff tears:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>M75.10, unspecified rotator cuff tear or rupture, not specified as traumatic</li>\r\n	<li>M75.11, incomplete rotator cuff tear or rupture not specified as traumatic</li>\r\n	<li>M75.12, complete rotator cuff tear or rupture not specified as traumatic</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nEach category includes three choices that specify laterality (right, left, unspecified) and each requires a seventh character for the encounter type.\r\n\r\nBased on Dr. Selig’s documentation, we will report a code in the M75.11- series because we know  Randy suffered an incomplete tear. And because this is a follow up visit, we would report:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>M75.112D, incomplete rotator cuff tear or rupture of left shoulder, not specified as traumatic, subsequent visit</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nNotice that the code itself does not specify which tendon the patient injured. However, if we look under  M75.1, rotator cuff tear or rupture, not specified as traumatic, we find these codes include:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Rotator cuff syndrome</li>\r\n	<li>Supraspinatus tear or rupture, not specified as traumatic</li>\r\n	<li>Supraspinatus syndrome</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe also find an Excludes1 note for a tear of rotator cuff, traumatic (S46.01-). Dr. Selig documented a non-traumatic injury so we would stay with the M75.112D.\r\n\r\nTommy came in to see Dr. Selig after today’s game with pain on the inside of his elbow, numbness in the small finger and ring finger, and a decreased ability to throw a baseball.\r\n\r\nAfter examining Tommy, Dr. Selig documents:\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"> <em>Initial visit for patient with torn ulnar collateral ligament, right elbow. Tear caused by slow deterioration of ligament due to pitching motion.</em></p>\r\nSo we know this is not a traumatic injury because it involves deterioration over time. Since Dr. Selig documented a tear, we’ll start by looking up tear in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index. Under tear, torn, we do not find ulnar collateral ligament, so let’s check just ligament. The entry for ligament directs us to see sprain.\r\n\r\nUnder sprain, we do find ulnar collateral ligament, but the entry directs us to see Rupture, traumatic, ligament, ulnar collateral. Hmm, that doesn’t seem correct. Dr. Selig documented the cause as slow deterioration, not a traumatic injury.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf we look under Sprain, elbow, we also find ulnar collateral ligament listed with code S53.44-. This looks better. In the Tabular List, S53.44 denotes ulnar collateral ligament sprain. Since we know this is the first visit for a right ulnar collateral ligament sprain, we would report:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S53.441A, ulnar collateral ligament sprain of right elbow, initial visit</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nOur final diamond casualty, Earl, arrives with a slightly different type of injury. Earl was in the dugout managing the Cardinals when he was hit by a flying bat. Apparently Reggie let go on the follow through. Sadly for Reggie’s team the Cubs, the only thing Reggie hit today was Earl. And he gave Earl a concussion and a nice big contusion to remember him by.\r\n\r\nEarl’s players badgered him into coming into the Fix ‘Em Up Clinic even though he didn’t lose consciousness. At least that’s what Earl claims. His players disagree and say he was out for two or three minutes, four minutes at most.\r\n\r\nDr. Selig documents the following in Earl’s chart:\r\n\r\n<em>Patient seen for initial visit. Suffered concussion after being hit in head by flying baseball bat during game. Suffered mild concussion with LOC less than 5 minutes. Contusion of forehead, no laceration, no foreign body, no underlying fracture. No other injuries noted.</em>\r\n\r\nLet’s start with Earl’s concussion. It doesn’t matter if Earl was out for three minutes or four. The first ICD-10-CM code for a concussion indicates loss of consciousness 30 minutes or fewer. He definitely wasn’t out longer than that, so we would report:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S06.0X1A, concussion with loss of consciousness of 30 minutes or less, initial visit</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nFor Earl’s contusion, we don’t have a code that specifies forehead, so we would report:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S00.83XA, contusion of other part of head, initial visit</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nNote that for this code, we know which part of the head is involved, we just don’t have a code for it. This is not the same as reporting an unspecified code if we don’t know the specific area.\r\n\r\nAnd because we know what Earl was doing when the injuries occurred, we can also report:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Y92.320, baseball field as the place of occurrence of the external cause</li>\r\n	<li>Y93.64, activity, baseball</li>\r\n	<li>W21.11XA, struck by baseball bat, initial visit</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWith that it’s time to head out to the field to catch the late game.

		'body' : 'Penny came into the Fix ‘Em Up emergency department Friday, complaining of tingling and numbness in her face and arm. She was also somewhat unsteady on her feet. Her husband Dave also reported Penny had trouble speaking and one side of her face was drooping.  By the time she arrived at the ED, her symptoms had resolved. Still, it turns out it was a good thing she came in.\r\n\r\nDr.  Morang saw Penny, listened to Dave, and after running some preliminary tests, diagnosed Penny with a transient ischemic attack (TIA). For the non-vascular and non-neurologic coders among us, a TIA is when blood flow to a part of the brain stops for a brief period of time. A person will have stroke-like symptoms for up to 24 hours, but in most cases symptoms only last for 1-2 hours.\r\n\r\nIn ICD-10-CM, we have the following choices for coding a TIA:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>G45.0, vertebro-basilar artery syndrome</li>\r\n	<li>G45.1, carotid artery syndrome (hemispheric)</li>\r\n	<li>G45.2, multiple and bilateral precerebral artery syndromes</li>\r\n	<li>G45.3, amaurosis fugax</li>\r\n	<li>G45.4, transient global amnesia</li>\r\n	<li>G45.8, other transient cerebral ischemic attacks and related syndromes</li>\r\n	<li>G45.9, transient cerebral ischemic attack, unspecified</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSo we need more information from Dr. Morang. So let’s send him a query. He responds that Penny suffered from carotid artery syndrome, so we report G45.1.\r\n\r\nDr. Morang ordered some additional tests (including an MRI and carotid artery duplex scan) and planned to see Penny (and Dave) in his office Tuesday after the test results are in. The MRI revealed that Penny did not suffer a TIA, she suffered a stroke.\r\n\r\nNow we have a new series of codes. When we look up stroke in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index, we find the following qualifiers all leading to the same code (I63.9):\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Apoplectic</li>\r\n	<li>Brain</li>\r\n	<li>Embolic</li>\r\n	<li>Ischemic</li>\r\n	<li>Paralytic</li>\r\n	<li>Thrombotic</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nTurns out, I63.9 is the code for cerebral infarction unspecified. That’s not a good code to use. We might get away with an unspecified code when we first start using ICD-10-CM, but I have a feeling payers won’t cover those diagnoses codes for long.\r\n\r\nInstead of settling for unspecified, let’ see if we can’t get to a more specific code. Cerebral infarctions fall under category I63. When you look it up in the Tabular Index, you’ll notice two notes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Includes occlusion and stenosis of cerebral and precerebral arteries, resulting in cerebral infarction</li>\r\n	<li>Use additional code, if applicable, to identify status post administration of tPA (rtPA) in a different facility within the last 24 hours prior to admission to current facility (Z92.82)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe don’t have to worry about an addition code in this case because Penny did not receive tPA. We’re just looking for a stroke code.\r\n\r\nIn order to narrow down the possibilities, we need to know what caused Penny’s stroke. Our broad choices include:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>I63.0, cerebral infarction due to thrombosis of precerebral arteries</li>\r\n	<li>I63.1, cerebral infarction due to embolism of precerebral arteries</li>\r\n	<li>I63.2, cerebral infarction due to unspecified occlusion or stenosis of precerebral arteries</li>\r\n	<li>I63.3, cerebral infarction due to thrombosis of cerebral arteries</li>\r\n	<li>I63.4, cerebral infarction due to embolism of cerebral arteries</li>\r\n	<li>I63.5, cerebral infarction due to unspecified occlusion or stenosis of cerebral arteries</li>\r\n	<li>I63.6, cerebral infarction due to cerebral venous thrombosis, nonpyogenic</li>\r\n	<li>I63.8, other cerebral infarction</li>\r\n	<li>I63.9, cerebral infarction, unspecified</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nOh, Dr. Morang, we have another question. Can you tell us, please, what kind of stroke Penny had? And which vessels were involved? And which side the vessels are on?\r\n\r\nOkay, that’s three questions, but querying coders really want to know.\r\n\r\nDr. Morang replies that Penny suffered a cerebral infarction due to occlusion of the right carotid arteries. That leads us to I63.231 (cerebral infarction due to unspecified occlusion or stenosis of right carotid arteries).\r\n\r\nPenny fortunately is expected to make a complete recovery. She’s going under the knife in a few weeks for what Dr. Morang calls “roto rootering of the arteries” (for the more medically minded, that’s a carotid endarterectomy).\r\n\r\nBut that is another visit. For now, we’ll wish Penny well and send Dr. Morang a quick thank you.',

Better yet, can you code for it?\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Knee-joint.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-2966\" title=\"ICD-10 knee derangement\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Knee-joint-300x246.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"246\" /></a>Coding for a derangement isn’t new. We have derangement codes in ICD-9-CM. For example, code series 717 contains codes for various internal derangements of the knee, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>717.0, old bucket handle tear of medial meniscus</li>\r\n	<li>717.1, derangement of anterior horn of medial meniscus</li>\r\n	<li>717.2, derangement of posterior horn of medial meniscus</li>\r\n	<li>717.3, other and unspecified derangement of medial meniscus</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIn most cases, the codes are fairly general. In fact, you don’t need any additional specification until you hit\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>717.4, derangement of lateral meniscus</li>\r\n	<li>717.8, other internal derangement of knee</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese two categories require a fifth digit that supplies additional detail.\r\n\r\nIn ICD-10-CM, internal derangements of the knee fall under M23.- and that category includes a lot more codes.\r\n\r\nYou’ll also find a Excludes1 note (meaning not coded here) for the following conditions:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Ankylosis (M24.66)</li>\r\n	<li>Current injury - see injury of knee and lower leg (S80-S89)</li>\r\n	<li>Deformity of knee (M21.-)</li>\r\n	<li>Osteochondritis dissecans (M93.2)</li>\r\n	<li>Recurrent dislocation or subluxation of joints (M24.4)</li>\r\n	<li>Recurrent dislocation or subluxation of patella (M22.0-M22.1)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAlmost all of the codes under category M23.- require a six-digit code, but none require a seventh character.\r\n\r\nWhen we look at the possibilities for types of knee derangement, we find the following general subcategories:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>M23.0, cystic meniscus</li>\r\n	<li>M23.2, derangement of meniscus due to old tear or injury</li>\r\n	<li>M23.3, other meniscus derangements</li>\r\n	<li>M23.4, loose body in knee</li>\r\n	<li>M23.5, chronic instability of knee</li>\r\n	<li>M23.6, other spontaneous disruption of ligament(s) of knee</li>\r\n	<li>M23.8, other internal derangements of knee</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAll of the codes include a character to indicate laterality:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>0 or 9 for unspecified, depending on the code series</li>\r\n	<li>1 for right</li>\r\n	<li>2 for left</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nFor codes under M23.4 and M23.5, that information occupies the fifth character position. For the remaining codes, that information is noted in the sixth character. So for example, if a patient suffers a spontaneous disruption of medial collateral ligament, you would choose one of these codes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>M23.631, other spontaneous disruption of medial collateral ligament of right knee</li>\r\n	<li>M23.632, other spontaneous disruption of medial collateral ligament of left knee</li>\r\n	<li>M23.639, other spontaneous disruption of medial collateral ligament of unspecified knee</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBe sure to look for documentation of the specific ligament, as well as laterality. ICD-10-CM also contains code series for:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>M23.60, other spontaneous disruption of unspecified ligament of knee</li>\r\n	<li>M23.62, other spontaneous disruption of posterior cruciate ligament of knee</li>\r\n	<li>M23.64, other spontaneous disruption of lateral collateral ligament of knee</li>\r\n	<li>M23.67, other spontaneous disruption of capsular ligament of knee</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAlso remember that other spontaneous disruption does not mean unspecified spontaneous disruption. Other means we have the information, but no code. Unspecified means we don’t know because our provider didn’t tell us.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of unspecified, category M23.- includes three unspecified codes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>M23.90, unspecified internal derangement of unspecified knee</li>\r\n	<li>M23.91, unspecified internal derangement of right knee</li>\r\n	<li>M23.92, unspecified internal derangement of left knee</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nNotice that M23.90 denotes an unspecified derangement of an unspecified knee. If you are reporting that code, you need to have a chat with your provider about basic documentation. Really, the provider should know (and note) which knee he or she examined.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;',

		'body' : 'Welcome to Stitch ‘Em Hospital, where we’re preparing for ICD-10-PCS by actually coding some of our procedures using the new system. We want to make sure we’re ready to go on October 1, 2014, and practice makes perfect.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately our encoder decided to take the day off, so we’ll need to use the ICD-10-PCS coding manual and the actual tables to code today’s case.\r\n\r\nToday’s patient, Penny, was initially seen at our sister facility, Fix ‘Em Up Clinic. Penny suffered a stroke as the result of a blockage in her right carotid artery. Her ICD-10-CM diagnosis is:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>I63.231, cerebral infarction due to unspecified occlusion or stenosis of right carotid arteries</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nPenny is in today for a right carotid endarterectomy to clean out the artery and reduce her changes for a future stroke. Dr. Ted will be performing her surgery.\r\n\r\nSo how do we code the right carotid endarterectomy? Let’s look at each of the seventh characters to see what our options are and build the actual code.\r\n\r\nThe first character denotes the section of the ICD-10-PCS manual. We’re looking up a surgery, so we would go to the Medical and Surgical section. That gives us a first character of 0 (zero). Note that ICD-10-PCS does not use letters I and O, because they can be confused with numbers 1 and 0.\r\n\r\nThe second character is the body system, where is the procedure being done. In Penny’s case, the surgeon is operating on her carotid artery, so we would use Upper Arteries as our body system. That gives us a second character of 3.\r\n\r\nOur next step is to determine the root operation of the procedure. Things can get a little tricky here because some of the root operations have very similar definitions.\r\n\r\nIn this case, you will find six different root operations that you might consider:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Drainage, taking or letting out fluids and/or gases from a body part</li>\r\n	<li>Excision, cutting out or off a portion of a body part using a sharp instrument</li>\r\n	<li>Extirpation, taking or cutting out solid matter from a body part</li>\r\n	<li>Extraction, pulling or stripping out or off all or a portion of a body part by the use of force</li>\r\n	<li>Fragmentation, breaking solid matter in a body part into pieces</li>\r\n	<li>Resection, cutting out or off, without replacement, all of a body part</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWhen determining the root operation, you need to know the intent of the procedure and what the physician is actually doing.\r\n\r\nWe can eliminate a couple of the potential root operations fairly quickly if we know what a carotid endarterectomy actually is. During a carotid endarterectomy, the surgeon removes plaque or other material that has built up on the lining of the artery wall. It is carried out by separating the plaque from the arterial wall.\r\n\r\nSo Dr. Ted is not cutting out or off all of a body part, so we can eliminate resection.\r\n\r\nHe is also not taking or letting out fluids or gases, he’s removing plaque. So cross off drainage.\r\n\r\nHe will not be removing a body part, the plaque is a foreign substance, so that eliminates excision.\r\n\r\nAnd since Dr. Ted is not removing a portion of a body part, we know we won’t be coding an extraction.\r\n\r\nThat leaves us with two choices:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Extirpation</li>\r\n	<li>Fragmentation</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nDr. Ted will be removing the plaque, not simply breaking it up. So for this case, our root operation is Extirpation, making our third character C.\r\n\r\nSo far, we have 03C as the beginning of our code. That will help us find the correct table in the ICD-10-PCS manual to fill in the remaining four characters.\r\n\r\nWhen we go to the table for 03C, we find 29 choices for a body part. That doesn’t mean 29 different arteries though. Almost all of choices include laterality, so for the vertebral artery, we have two choices (right or left) with their own body part character.\r\n\r\nWe know Dr. Ted is operating on Penny’s right carotid artery, so we should be able to quickly find the body part. Not so fast. It turns out ICD-10-PCS includes body part characters for three different right carotid arteries:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>H, common carotid artery, right</li>\r\n	<li>K, internal carotid artery, right</li>\r\n	<li>M, external carotid artery, right</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nHere’s where we really need Dr. Ted to document well. If he doesn’t state which artery he operated on, we’ll need to query.\r\n\r\nLet’s check his documentation first and see if the information is there. Keep in mind that for ICD-9-CM procedure coding, you don’t need this level of specificity, so your physicians may not be documenting it. (I would hope they are just from a medical record/patient care perspective.)\r\n\r\nIf physicians are not currently documenting this level of detail, start working with them to include it now so when we get to ICD-10-PCS, they’ll be in the habit of including the details you need to code.\r\n\r\nDr. Ted is apparently well trained (or we’ve just queried him to death about this already) because he documented the right common carotid. Our fourth character therefore is H.\r\n\r\nThe fifth character represents the approach. In the table for 03C, we only have three possible choices for a fifth character:\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">0 Open</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">3 Percutaneous</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">4 Percutaneous endoscopic</p>\r\n Dr. Ted documented an open approach, so we would use 0 as our fifth character.\r\n\r\nThat leaves characters six and seven, which will be a breeze for this procedure. Character six presents a device character and character seven is used for qualifiers. The table lists only on possibility character for both: Z. So we would report Z as character six and seven, making our final code:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>03CH0ZZ, extirpation of matter from right common carotid artery, open approach</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nDr. Ted reports the operation is a success and Penny is expected to make a full recovery. Now if only we could get the encoder back up and running!',

		'body' : 'Labor Day might mark the unofficial end of summer, but we have plenty of summer-related injuries today at the Fix ‘Em Up Clinic.\r\n\r\nOur first guest of the day, James, went rock climbing for the first (and he vows the last) time over the weekend. Instead of reaching the summit and enjoying a spectacular view, James lost his grip and ended up looking up at the summit from his back.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Sweating-sun.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright  wp-image-2974\" title=\"Sweating sun\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Sweating-sun-292x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"212\" height=\"217\" /></a>Fortunately, James did not suffer any life-threatening injuries.  Dr. Hoffa documented the following:\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Patient James seen for initial encounter of wrist and hand fractures suffered during fall while rock climbing at state park. James also suffered abrasions to left forearm, wrist, and hand. No head trauma or internal injuries noted.</em></p>\r\nOff to our trusty ICD-10-CM coding manual to begin coding James’ case. Almost immediately, we realize we have a problem. Well, it’s really a lack of information.\r\n\r\nDr. Hoffa documented hand and wrist fractures. When we look up a wrist fracture, we are directed to S62 (fracture at wrist and hand level) and four pages of possible codes. Yikes.\r\n\r\nBefore we send Dr. Hoffa a query, let’s make sure we know everything we don’t know so he can fill in the blanks all at once.\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Is the fracture displaced or non-displaced?</li>\r\n	<li>Which specific bone is broken?</li>\r\n	<li>Is the fracture open or closed?</li>\r\n	<li>Which wrist is involved—left or right?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nA note under S62 tells us to code a fracture as displaced if it is not specified. Further we are instructed to code the fracture as closed if that information is not provided. Since we need other information from Dr. Hoffa, we’ll clear those two points up as well.\r\n\r\nDr. Hoffa sends back the following response:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Patient suffered closed, displaced fractures of navicular , pisiform, and cuneiform bones of right wrist.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nGreat. Now we should be all set. Or not. Turns out ICD-10-CM includes three sets of codes for fractures of the navicular:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Distal pole</li>\r\n	<li>Middle third</li>\r\n	<li>Proximal third</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nLooks like we’ll have to ask Dr. Hoffa for more info. When we receive his response to our follow up query, we learn that James fractured both the middle and proximal third of the navicular. Because we know this is an initial visit, we can code the wrist fractures as follows:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S62.021A, displaced fracture of middle third of navicular [scaphoid] bone of right wrist, initial visit</li>\r\n	<li>S62.031A, displaced fracture of proximal third of navicular [scaphoid] bone of right wrist, initial visit</li>\r\n	<li>S62.111A, displaced fracture of triquetrum [cuneiform] bone, right wrist</li>\r\n	<li>S62.161A, displaced fracture of pisiform, right wrist, initial visit</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThat takes care of James’ multiple wrist fractures. On to the hand fractures.\r\n\r\nIn the Alphabetic Index, under traumatic fracture, hand, we find these possibilities:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>carpal —see Fracture, carpal bone</li>\r\n	<li>finger (except thumb) —see Fracture, finger</li>\r\n	<li>metacarpal —see Fracture, metacarpal</li>\r\n	<li>navicular (scaphoid) (hand) —see Fracture, carpal bone, navicular</li>\r\n	<li>thumb —see Fracture, thumb</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nOh, Dr. Hoffa, we need more information!\r\n\r\nDr. Hoffa responds that James suffered displaced fractures of the second, third, and fourth metacarpal bones, but did not fracture any fingers.\r\n\r\nOkay, but we still need to know which part of the bones he fractured (yes, ICD-10-CM is that specific):\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Base</li>\r\n	<li>Shaft</li>\r\n	<li>Neck</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nTurns out all of the fractures were to the base of the metacarpals. That leads us to:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S62.310A, displaced fracture of base of second metacarpal bone, right hand, initial visit</li>\r\n	<li>S62.312A, displaced fracture of base of third metacarpal bone, right hand, initial visit</li>\r\n	<li>S62.314A, displaced fracture of base of fourth metacarpal bone, right hand, initial visit</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nNow on to the abrasions. Dr. Hoffa only documented abrasions to the hand, but we should probably query to make sure none of the fingers are involved, because they have their own codes. And we find out no fingers involved, just the left hand.\r\n\r\nSo we would code:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S60.512A, abrasion of left hand, initial visit</li>\r\n	<li>S50.812A, abrasion of left forearm, initial visit</li>\r\n	<li>S60.812A, abrasion of left wrist, initial visit</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe can also add some external cause codes as well, if our payer wants them. (Think E codes in ICD-9-CM).\r\n\r\nFor James, we know what he was doing (rock climbing), where (state park), and what happened (fall ). Our codes would be:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>W15.XXXA, fall from cliff, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>Y92.830, public park as the place of occurrence of the external cause</li>\r\n	<li>Y93.31, activity, mountain climbing, rock climbing and wall climbing</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nChoosing a code for the fall is a little problematic because we have a lot of choices for a fall. We know it was accidental. We know he fell from a height to the ground. Since he was rock climbing, I would call that a cliff.\r\n\r\nYou could argue for using the unspecified code (W19.XXXA, unspecified fall , initial encounter). But that’s generally used only if you don’t have specific information.\r\n\r\nYou could also make an argument for W17.89XA (other fall from one level to another, initial encounter) because he fell from a height.\r\n\r\nEven though we haven’t firmly resolved that question, we’re going to move on to our next patient, Karin. Karin went mountain biking over the weekend in a forest and encountered an unhappy black racer snake. Fortunately for Karin, black racers are non-venomous snakes.\r\n\r\nShe ended up with a nasty puncture wound on her left leg. Karin knows how to treat a snake bite so the wound did not become infected, but she wanted to have someone take a look just to be sure. This is Karin’s first visit to Fix ‘Em Up.\r\n\r\nWhen we look up bite, reptile, nonvenomous, the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index directs us to see bite, by site. So we’re coding for the location of the injury, not the animal that bit Karin.\r\n\r\nThat leads us to:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S81.852A, open bite, left lower leg, initial visit</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nTo add further details to Karin’s record, we could also code:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>W59.11, bitten by nonvenomous snake</li>\r\n	<li>Y92.821, forest as the place of occurrence of the external cause</li>\r\n	<li>Y93.55, activity, bike riding</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThat’s all for today’s wounded at Fix ‘Em Up Clinic. Hopefully, fall will be a slower season, but I’m not counting on it!',

		'body' : 'By now, you probably know that ICD-10-PCS codes contain seven alpha-numeric characters. Each character represents a specific piece of information and those meanings can vary by section.\r\n\r\nIn the Medical and Surgical section of ICD-10-PCS, the fourth character represents the body part. That sounds pretty simple and straightforward, right? You pick the body part that represents the site of the procedure.\r\n\r\nIt is—and it isn’t—that simple. Some of the body parts are very specific, such as right cephalic vein. Others are more general, such as subcutaneous tissue and fascia, abdomen.\r\n\r\nHere are some things to keep in mind when choosing the fourth character for your ICD-10-PCS code:\r\n\r\nIf the provider performs a procedure on a portion of a body part that does not have a separate body part value, code the body part value corresponding to the whole body part. For example, when the provider performs a procedure on the alveolar process of the mandible, you would use  the mandible body part.\r\n\r\nWhere a specific branch of a body part does not have its own body part value, use the closest proximal branch that has a specific body part value. For example, the surgeon destroys part of the trifacial nerve. ICD-10-PCS does not include a specific fourth character for that nerve, so you would code it to the trigeminal nerve.\r\n\r\nSome body parts have a fourth character for procedures performed bilaterally. If the provider performs the exact same procedure on both body parts, for example the fallopian tubes, assign the fourth character for fallopian tubes bilateral. If the body part does not have a bilateral choice, code each procedure separately. For example, a patient undergoes bilateral knee replacement. You would report two procedure codes—one with the fourth character for the right knee, the other with the fourth character for the left knee.\r\n\r\nNot sure what ICD-10-PCS includes in a body part? No problem. ICD-10-PCS includes a body part key to help.\r\n\r\nIf you look up zygomatic process of frontal bone, the key directs you to code the procedure to either frontal bone, right, or frontal bone, left.',

Then we’re going to code her procedure.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Leg-vein.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-2991\" title=\"Leg vein\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Leg-vein-112x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"112\" height=\"300\" /></a>Dr. Larry is harvesting part of the patient’s saphenous vein to use as a graft in heart bypass surgery. In ICD-9-CM, we can’t code the vein harvest as a separate procedure. It is included in the bypass procedure.\r\n\r\nHowever, in ICD-10-PCS, we can code both procedures according to guideline B3.9: “If an autograft is obtained from a different body part in order to complete the objective of the procedure, a separate procedure is coded.”\r\n\r\nSo we know we are in the Medical and Surgical section of ICD-10-PCS, which gives us a first character of 0. We know we are dealing with a lower vein (the saphenous vein is located in the leg), which gives us a second character 6.\r\n\r\nNow we need to determine what root operation Dr. Larry is performing. She is cutting out a portion of the vein, which leads us to root operation, Extraction. That makes our third character B.\r\n\r\nOur code so far then is 06B.\r\n\r\nOn to the table for 06B. In order to select the correct fourth character, we need to know which specific vein (greater or less saphenous) and which side (left or right). Dr. Larry documented greater saphenous of the left leg, which gives us a fourth character of Q.\r\n\r\nWe also need to know which approached Dr. Larry used to harvest the vein:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Open</li>\r\n	<li>Percutaneous</li>\r\n	<li>Percutanous endoscopic</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAll three are possible choices for the fifth character. In this case, Dr. Larry documented a percutanous endoscopic approach. So our fifth character is 4.\r\n\r\nThe table provides only one option for character 6 (the device), so we know our sixth character is Z.\r\n\r\nThat leaves the seventh character. The table gives us two options:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Diagnostic</li>\r\n	<li>No qualifier</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe know the procedure is not diagnostic. Dr. Larry is harvesting a vein, so we’ll use a seventh character Z, no qualifier.\r\n\r\nThat makes our code: 06BQ4ZZ.\r\n\r\nNow, where did that vein go?',

Or maybe you had one too many cups of coffee.\r\n\r\nNever fear, we have plenty of ICD-10-CM insomnia codes for you. In fact, the insomnia codes take up almost a full column in the Alphabetic Index.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/tired-eyes.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright  wp-image-2998\" title=\"tired eyes\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/tired-eyes-300x236.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"262\" height=\"206\" /></a>The American Academy of Sleep Medicine actually lists 11 types of insomnia. Well, now we know why ICD-10-CM includes so many insomnia codes.\r\n\r\nIn order to code our insomnia, we need to know the cause.\r\n\r\nIs it stress-related insomnia? If so, we would code F51.02, adjustment insomnia. This type of insomnia usually comes and goes, and is related to stress. It’s also known as acute insomnia or short-term insomnia. So if you’re worried about your child’s first sleepover or freaked out about work, you probably have adjustment insomnia.\r\n\r\nNote that only a doctor can properly diagnose our insomnia issues, but it’s fun to speculate.\r\n\r\nLet’s see what else could be keeping us up all night.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we should have skipped that 2 a.m. coffee run to Starbucks and the venti espresso macchiato. That leads us to insomnia due to caffeine, but are we suffering from caffeine abuse, dependence, or use?\r\n\r\nHmm, Starbucks isn’t a regular stop, so we’ll say caffeine use, and our code would be:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>F15.982, other stimulant use, unspecified with stimulant-induced sleep disorder</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nCategory F15 (other stimulant related disorders) includes amphetamine-related disorders and caffeine, so too much coffee or soda lands here.\r\n\r\nNote that use, abuse, and dependence have different codes, so the physician will need to document not only the substance (in our case caffeine), but also differentiate between use, abuse, and dependence. The same holds true for other stimulants, such as amphetamines, cocaine, opioids, and stimulants.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we really suffer from an anxiety disorder. That’s a depressing thought, but it could be why we’re wide awake in the middle of the night. That takes us to:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>F51.05, insomnia due to other mental disorder</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe also need to code the specific mental disorder causing the insomnia, so if we suffered from generalized anxiety disorder, we would also code:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>F41.1, generalized anxiety disorder</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nMaybe our wakefulness is because we just got back from a trip to Ireland and we’re still on Irish time. In that case, we may actually be suffering from circadian rhythm disorder and our code would be:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>G47.25, circadian rhythm sleep disorder, jet lag type</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nOh, wait, that trip was just a dream. Guess we have to go back to the more mundane explanations. Better yet, let’s put in the DVD of Tree of Life and see if we can get some sleep instead.',

		'body' : 'Athenian philosopher Socrates famously drank poisonoud hemlock after being found guilty of corrupting the minds of the youth of Athens and of impiety for not believing in the gods of the state. According to Xenophon, Socrates claimed in his trial defense that he would be glad to circumvent the rigors of old age by being sentenced to death.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Goblet.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright  wp-image-3003\" title=\"Goblet\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Goblet-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"179\" height=\"239\" /></a>Unfortunately for Hippocrates and the ancient Athenian coders, ICD-1 wasn’t even around when Socrates gulped his hemlock cocktail, so they couldn’t code his untimely death due to poisoning. Let’s do it for them with ICD-10-CM.\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM’s Table of Drugs includes four categories of poisoning:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Accidental</li>\r\n	<li>Intentional self-harm</li>\r\n	<li>Assault</li>\r\n	<li>Undetermined</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIn Socrates’ case, he voluntarily drank the hemlock. When we check the Table of Drugs, we find T62.2X2 for hemlock poisoning, intentional self-harm. Being the experienced coders we are, we check the Alphabetic Index and learn we need a seventh character for our poisoning code. Since Socrates died (and thus couldn’t have a follow up), we’ll report an initial encounter. That give us:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>T62.2X2A, toxic effect of other ingested (parts of) plant(s), intentional self-harm, initial encounter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWhat if the poisoning was accidental, as in the case of composer Johann Schobert. Schobert died after consuming poisonous mushrooms he believed were edible.\r\n\r\nThe Table of Drugs directs us to T62.0X1A for noxious mushrooms, which is almost the same code we reported for Socrates. (Note that both are initial visits since both died.) The difference is the sixth character:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>1 for accidental poisoning (Schobert)</li>\r\n	<li>2 for intentional self-harm (Socrates)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nGrigori Rasputin, the Mad Monk of Russia, was poisoned by cyanide by a group of Russian nobles who objected to Rasputin’s influence over Czar Nicholas II and his wife Alexandra.\r\n\r\nThe Table of Drugs includes several possibilities for cyanide poisoning, depending on how the cyanide is ingested:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Cyanide(s) (compounds) (potassium)(sodium) NEC</li>\r\n	<li>dust or gas (inhalation) NEC</li>\r\n	<li>fumigant</li>\r\n	<li>hydrogen</li>\r\n	<li>mercuric—see Mercury</li>\r\n	<li>pesticide(dust) (fumes)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe conspirators mixed potassium cyanide with wine and in tea cakes so we know what kind of cyanide. We also know Rasputin was the victim of an assault. He eventually died after being beaten and thrown in a river, so we’ll assume this is again an initial visit. That gives us:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>T65.0X3A, toxic effect of cyanides, assault, initial encounter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe abbreviation NEC (not elsewhere classified) will look familiar. We have the same thing in ICD-9-CM. NEC means we have the specific information but don’t have a more specific code available. You’ll see NEC pop up periodically on the Table of Drugs.\r\n\r\nSo be sure to check what’s in your cup so you don’t end up like Artaxerxes (III and IV).',

Let’s see what she’s up to today.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/blood-drop.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-3008\" title=\"blood drop\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/blood-drop-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>For all of Dr. Larry’s procedures, we’re going to be coding from the Medical and Surgical section, so our first character will always be 0. Our second character will represent which blood vessels she’s working on:\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">2, Heart and great vessels</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">3, Upper arteries</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">4, Lower arteries</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">5, Upper veins</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">6, Lower veins</p>\r\nNot sure where that blood vessel lives? Check Appendix C, the Body Part Key in the ICD-10-PCS Manual.\r\n\r\nThe procedure Dr. Larry performs will determine our third character, so let’s see what she’s documented in today’s first record.\r\n\r\nDr. Larry placed two drug-eluting stents in a patient’s left anterior descending coronary artery. So we know we are coding a procedure on the coronary artery, which means our second character is 2.\r\n\r\nFor coronary artery procedures, the ICD-10-PCS guidelines state:\r\n\r\n<em>The coronary arteries are classified as a single body part that is further specified by number of sites treated and not by name or number of arteries. Separate body part values are used to specify the number of sites treated when the same procedure is performed on multiple sites in the coronary arteries.</em>\r\n\r\nWhat is our root operation? We have two possibilities:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Dilation</li>\r\n	<li>Insertion</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWhat is the intent of the procedure—to open up the vessels or to place a nonbiological appliance to assist in the physiological function.\r\n\r\nDr. Larry documents the procedure is done to open narrowing of the artery, which makes our root operation Dilation (third character 7).\r\n\r\nSince we now have the first three characters (027) we know which table to use.\r\n\r\nThe table includes choices for 1-4 sites in the coronary artery. Dr. Larry placed two stents, so we would use fourth character 2 (coronary artery, two sites).\r\n\r\nIt doesn’t matter which coronary artery is involved per the guidelines. The fourth character is determined by the number of sites treated.\r\n\r\nDr. Larry documented a percutaneous approach, so our fifth character is 3. And we know she used a drug eluting stent, so our sixth character is 4.\r\n\r\nDr. Larry did not document any bifurcation, so our seventh character is Z.\r\n\r\nPut together, our code is:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>027134Z, dilation of coronary artery, two sites with drug-eluting intraluminal device, percutaneous approach</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nDr. Larry’s second procedure involves draining excess fluid from a patient’s colic artery. The colic artery is a lower artery and we know we are coding a drainage. That leads us to the table for 049.\r\n\r\nIn order to select the appropriate fourth character, we need to know which colic artery is involved:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>6, Right</li>\r\n	<li>7, Left</li>\r\n	<li>8, Middle</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nDr. Larry’s procedure notes specify right colic artery. She also documented use of a drainage device and a percutaneous approach. So our code is:\r\n\r\n049630Z, drainage of right colic artery with drainage device, percutaneous approach\r\n\r\nOur final patient of the day suffers from some really nasty spider veins, so Dr. Larry is performing microincisional phlebectomy.\r\n\r\nSo what root operation is microincisional phlebectomy? Here’s where it helps to have clinical knowledge or good rapport with your clinical staff. Since we’re on good terms with Dr. Larry, we asked her to explain the procedure in layman’s terms.\r\n\r\nPhlebectomy involves making small incisions or needle punctures to extract the problematic veins with a phlebectomy hook. A hook is inserted into a microncision in the leg. A section of the vein is hooked and then removed through the incision.\r\n\r\nAnd that translates to which root operation? Maybe extirpation? Wait, that involves taking solid matter out of a body part. Scratch that.\r\n\r\nMaybe it’s excision. We are removing a portion of a body part, sort of.\r\n\r\nWait, what about extraction? I think we’re on to something here. Extraction is defined as pulling or stripping out or off all or a portion of a body part by the use of force.\r\n\r\nWell, pulling a vein out with a hook certainly sounds like force to me. (It also sounds really painful.) Extraction it is.\r\n\r\nFor extraction of lower leg veins, we don’t need to know the specific vessels involved, we just need the approach.\r\n\r\nDr. Larry’s procedure notes supply that information percutaneous, which gives us:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>06DY3ZZ, Microincisional phlebectomy of spider veins, lower leg</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAnd on that really painful note, we’re wrapping up for the day.',

We know ICD-10-CM is big on laterality, so we’ll need to know which knee Tom injured. What else?\r\n\r\nWe already know which specific ligaments Tom injured—anterior cruiciate and medical collateral.\r\n\r\nFor the torn medial meniscus, we need to know which type of tear Tom sustained:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Bucket-handle tear</li>\r\n	<li>Peripheral tear</li>\r\n	<li>Complex tear</li>\r\n	<li>Other tear</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nOther tear does not mean unspecified tear. It means that we don’t have a code for the specific type of tear Dr. Lombardi documented. ICD-10-CM does offer a code for unspecified tear, but we want to avoid those codes as much as possible.\r\n\r\nFor all of these injuries, we also need to know the encounter so we can add the correct seventh character.\r\n\r\nWhen we read Dr. Lombardi’s documentation, we learn the following:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Tom is being seen for an initial visit for all three injuries</li>\r\n	<li>Injuries sustained to right knee</li>\r\n	<li>Complex tear of medial meniscus</li>\r\n	<li>Injuries suffered during a football game</li>\r\n	<li>Game played at high school field</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWith that information, we would report these codes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S83.511A, sprain of anterior cruciate ligament of right knee, initial visit</li>\r\n	<li>S83.411A, sprain of medial collateral ligament of right knee, initial visit</li>\r\n	<li>S83.231A, complex tear of medial meniscus, current injury, right knee, initial visit</li>\r\n	<li>W21.81XA, striking against or struck by football helmet, initial visit</li>\r\n	<li>Y92.321, football field as the place of occurrence of the external cause</li>\r\n	<li>Y93.61, activity, American tackle football</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSo much for Tom’s injuries and his season.\r\n\r\nCornerback Deion suffered a pretty strange injury—a cleat puncture wound to the knee.\r\n\r\nApparently one of the other team’s players lost a cleat and was left with the screw sticking out of his shoe. As Deion wrapped up the wide receiver, the other player accidentally stepped on Deion (he was losing his balance so we can’t blame him for putting his foot down).\r\n\r\nSadly for Deion, that foot came down on his knee and the exposed screw found a place without padding. Result: puncture wound of the knee.\r\n\r\nDr. Lombardi notes that no foreign body remained in the left knee. No blood vessels or other structures of the knee were injured and this is Deion’s first visit. We would code:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S81.032A, puncture wound without foreign body, left knee, initial visit</li>\r\n	<li>Y92.321, football field as the place of occurrence of the external cause</li>\r\n	<li>Y93.61, activity, American tackle football</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSteve, Anytown’s punter, didn’t make it out of the game unscathed either. One of the opposing team’s players tried to block Steve’s punt, missed the ball, and took out Steve’s knee and his kneecap.\r\n\r\nDr. Lombardi documents the following:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Traumatic lateral patella dislocation</li>\r\n	<li>Initial visit</li>\r\n	<li>Right knee</li>\r\n	<li>No other ligament damage</li>\r\n	<li>Significant contusion to right thigh</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThat gives us the following codes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S83.014A, lateral dislocation of right patella, initial visit</li>\r\n	<li>S70.11XA, contusion of right thigh, initial visit</li>\r\n	<li>Y92.321, football field as the place of occurrence of the external cause</li>\r\n	<li>Y93.61, activity, American tackle football</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe don’t know if the blocker’s helmet caused the injury, so we would not add W21.81XA.\r\n\r\nIs there a kicker not in the clinic?',

Since borderline conditions are not uncertain diagnoses, no distinction is made between the care setting (inpatient versus outpatient). Whenever the documentation is unclear regarding a borderline condition, coders are encouraged to query for clarification.</em></p>\r\nHow nice. We all get to code it same way.

It’s time to prepare, practice, and plan.\r\n\r\nThe transition will be a huge endeavor, but we need to remember why we’re doing it, <strong>Gloryanne Bryant, BS, RHIA, RHIT, CCS, CDIP, CCDS,</strong> an HIM professional and leader for more than 30 years. “The reasons we’re moving to ICD-10 are getting lost. We’re doing this for the right reasons.”\r\n\r\nThose reasons include:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Better data collection</li>\r\n	<li>More accurate clinical picture of the patient’s health</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSo now when the physicians say, “My patients are in the hospital longer because they’re sicker,” they can prove it.\r\n\r\nDon’t focus on the negatives, Bryant advises. Instead stress the positives, especially when you are working to educate staff members.\r\n\r\nWhen CMS first announced plans to move to ICD-10, many people looked at the increase in the number of codes and started planning their retirement parties for September 30, 2013. But it’s really not that bad.\r\n\r\nICD-10 requires more specificity and that alone accounts for a larger percentage of the additional codes. For example, for a patient suffering from impacted cerumen (wax in the ear), you would report ICD-9 code 380.4.\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM offers four codes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>H61.20, impacted cerumen, unspecified ear</li>\r\n	<li>H61.21, impacted cerumen, right ear</li>\r\n	<li>H61.22, impacted cerumen, left ear</li>\r\n	<li>H61.23, impacted cerumen, bilateral</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe only difference is ICD-10-CM specifies which ear in involved. Chances are the providers are already documenting that information, we’re just not looking for it because right now, we don’t need to know.\r\n\r\nOther diseases will be more challenging because they involve more change. By now, you’ve probably heard about the major changes to coding diabetes.\r\n\r\nThose changes will require you to modify any templates or forms you have for each specialty or department that might see a diabetic patient. Sounds like a lot of work, doesn’t it?\r\n\r\nYes and no. You’ll need to spend time comparing the information you’ll need to what you have and determine how to modify the forms. But once you do that for one department, say primary care, you can tweak the changes to make them applicable in other departments, says Thea Campbell, MBA, RHIA, who oversees HIM at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. You don’t need to reinvent the wheel every time and you don’t need to solve the same problem over and over. Fix it once, then adjust the changes.\r\n\r\nSo keep calm, carry on with your transition plans, and don’t worry about something falling on your head.',

Fenton joined forces with UASI, an HIM consulting firm, and the University of Cincinnati Health, University Hospital to conduct a small study into coder productivity in ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-PCS.\r\n\r\nThe study involved only six coders, so it is not a comprehensive study, Fenton said. Rather than have coders code the same records in ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-PCS, Fenton’s team selected 54 records, then divided the records in half. Coders coded 27 records in ICD-9-CM and 27 different records in ICD-10-PCS. The group selected cases that were as close as possible in complexity and type.\r\n\r\nCoders need an average of 25.51 minutes to code an inpatient record in ICD-9-CM, Fenton said. In ICD-10-PCS, that time jumps to 43.23 minutes, a 69% increase. That number came as a surprise to Fenton and Mary Stanfill, MBI, RHIA, CCS-P, CCS, FAHIMA, vice president of HIM consulting services for UASI.\r\n\r\nThe study team found a huge range in the coders’ productivity. The six coders included took anywhere from an additional 10.6 minutes (31.6%) to 27.78 minutes (89.8%) on average.\r\n\r\nBecause the team is still analyzing the results, they have not yet looked at the accuracy of the code assignment or analyzed how experience and education affect productivity.\r\n\r\nThe study did highlight the importance of training. The difference between the well trained coders and the not-well-trained coders was significant, Stanfill said. “That tells me that training is worth it.”',

He also had a red, inflamed area on his left thigh that had been growing.\r\n\r\nDr. Grubber documents that Tony was bitten by an insect on the thigh while playing rugby last week. Apparently Tony was in no hurry to come into the clinic, even though the rash around the bite kept growing. After running some blood tests, Dr. Grubber diagnoses Tony with cellulitis.\r\n\r\nFortunately for Tony, he’s not septic or suffering from any other illnesses, although he has plenty of past injuries documented in his chart.\r\n\r\nFor this visit, however, we’re just coding for cellulitis.\r\n\r\nWhen we look up cellulitis in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index, we find plenty of choices. ICD-10-CM classifies cellulitis by the affected site. So for Tony, that’s left thigh.\r\n\r\nScanning down the list of sites, we come to “thigh” which directs us to cellulitis, lower limb. Cellulitis lower limb lists L03.11-. That little dash on the end of the code tells us the code requires additional characters.\r\n\r\nOff to the Tabular Index, where we find: L03.11, Cellulitis of other parts of limb.\r\n\r\nWell we know lower left limb, which gives us ICD-10-CM code:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>L03.116, cellulitis of left lower limb</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nHank, another member of the rugby squad, also came in for an insect-related illness. Instead of being a snack for a gnat, Hank spent time entertaining some ticks. He presents with a circular, outwardly expanding rash on his right arm.\r\n\r\nDr. Grubber diagnoses Lyme disease with no complications, and we’re off to the Alphabetic Index. We find only one code for Lyme disease: A69.20. The code doesn’t include a dash at the end, so it probably doesn’t need additional characters. Just to be safe (and because we never code from the Alphabetic Index), we’re off to check the listing in the Tabular Index.\r\n\r\nUnder A69.2 (Lyme disease), we find the following choices:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>A69.20, Lyme disease, unspecified</li>\r\n	<li>A69.21, meningitis due to Lyme disease</li>\r\n	<li>A69.22, other neurologic disorders in Lyme disease</li>\r\n	<li>A69.23, arthritis due to Lyme disease</li>\r\n	<li>A69.29, other conditions associated with Lyme disease</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nDr. Grubber didn’t document any other conditions associated with Hank’s Lyme disease, so we’re stuck with A69.20, even though it is an unspecified code.\r\n\r\nHank wasn’t the only rugby player to fall afoul of the ticks. After the team’s trip to Colorado, Jeff started feeling not so good. He ignored his fever, nausea, and lack of appetite, but the petechial rash and abdominal pain sent him running (okay, lurching) for the clinic.\r\n\r\nDr. Grubber documents spotted fever. If we look up spotted fever in the Alphabetic Index, we are directed to Fever, spotted and a whole list of possibilities, depending on the cause of the spotted fever.\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>A77.0, spotted fever due to Rickettsia rickettsii</li>\r\n	<li>A77.1, spotted fever due to Rickettsia conorii</li>\r\n	<li>A77.2, spotted fever due to Rickettsia siberica</li>\r\n	<li>A77.3, spotted fever due to Rickettsia australis</li>\r\n	<li>A77.4, ehrlichiosis</li>\r\n	<li>A77.8, other spotted fevers</li>\r\n	<li>A77.9, spotted fever, unspecified</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWhen we read the rest of Dr. Grubber’s note, we find that he specified Rocky Mountain spotted fever, which falls under:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>A77.0, spotted fever due to Rickettsia rickettsii</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\">Rocky Mountain spotted fever</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\">Sao Paulo fever</p>\r\n Fortunately, Dr. Grubber is predicting a complete recovery for all three patients, but warned them to be wary of insects in the future.

		'body' : 'Legendary Green Bay Packers coach Vince Lombardi once described the ideal linebacker as agile, hostile, and mobile. Sadly, some of our local linebackers are significantly less agile and somewhat immobile after their weekend quest for gridiron glory went awry.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Football.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-3071\" title=\"Football\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Football-300x201.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"201\" /></a>First into the Fix ‘Em Up Clinic this Monday is Jack, who claims to be the victim of the Turf Monster. It seems Jack tried to tackle a running back, but his foot got stuck in the artificial turf. He is complaining of pain, swelling, and limited joint movement at the base of one big toe.\r\n\r\nDr. Rooney diagnoses Jack with turf toe of the right big toe, a condition that unfortunately does not appear in the ICD-10-CM index.  So we need to read through Dr. Rooney’s notes to see if she provided a more ICD-10-CM friendly diagnosis.\r\n\r\nIn the body of Dr. Rooney’s note, we find the following documentation: “Hyperdorsiflexion injury of the first metatarsophalangeal, initial visit. Patient suffered injury while pushing off of foot to make a tackle on football field.”\r\n\r\nExcellent, that’s a diagnosis we can find in ICD-10-CM and in fact it leads us to:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S93.521A, sprain of metatarsophalangeal joint of right great toe, initial encounter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nLike more ICD-10-CM injury codes, this one requires a seventh character to denote the encounter. Since Dr. Rooney documented initial visit, we add the seventh character A. When Jack comes in to see Dr. Rooney for follow-up (always assuming he is following doctor’s orders), we’ll use the same base code and just change the seventh character to D (subsequent visit) or S (sequela).\r\n\r\nRemember, though, that Dr. Rooney will need to document the exact injury again in any subsequent visits. We can’t take “follow up for turf toe” and come up with a code. We’ll need more detail in that visit note.\r\n\r\nIf Jack comes back and sees a physician other than Dr. Rooney, we’re back to A for the seventh character. According to the ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting, seventh character A is used while the patient is receiving active treatment for the condition. Examples of active treatment are:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Surgical treatment</li>\r\n	<li>ED encounter</li>\r\n	<li>Evaluation and treatment by a new physician</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nFor Jack’s injury, we can also add external cause codes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Y92.321A, football field as the place of occurrence of the external cause</li>\r\n	<li>Y93.61, activity, American tackle football</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe Turf Monster claimed a second victim with linebacker Chris, who planted his foot to make a cut in pursuit of the quarterback and felt something pop.\r\n\r\nTurns out that pop was his Achilles tendon rupturing. Dr. Rooney documents a complete traumatic rupture of the left Achilles tendon, initial visit.\r\n\r\nWhen we look up a traumatic rupture in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index, we are directed to see Strain. Note that under Rupture, ICD-10-CM does include numerous non-traumatic and traumatic injuries. A ruptured Achilles tendon is not among them, so we’re off to look under Strain.\r\n\r\nThe listing under Strain is pretty small, just 12 entries. Unfortunately, none are for Achilles tendon. Instead, we are directed to see Injury, muscle, by site, strain.\r\n\r\nUnder Injury, we finally find what we’re looking for: Achilles tendon strain (S86.01-). We also see another possibility, Other specified injury of Achilles tendon (S86.09). Dr. Rooney documented a complete rupture, not a strain. So which code do we report?\r\n\r\nHere’s where our knowledge and experience (and helpful clinical staff) come in handy. Tendon strains are divided into three grades:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Grade 1 (mild strain) involves a slight pull of the tendon and microscopic tendon tearing with no loss of strength or change in tendon length.</li>\r\n	<li>Grade 2 s is characterized by tearing of tendon fibers within the tendon or at the tendon bone junction. The tendon’s length increases and strength usually decreases.</li>\r\n	<li>Grade 3 is a complete rupture of the tendon.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThat means Chris suffered a grade 3 Achilles tendon strain, which gives us:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S86.012A, strain of left Achilles tendon, initial encounter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAnd depending on our payer requirements and preferences, we could also add:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Y92.321A, football field as the place of occurrence of the external cause</li>\r\n	<li>Y93.61, activity, American tackle football</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe Turf Monster apparently had quite the appetite this weekend. Our final football victim, I mean visitor, Jamaal, came in with bruising, tenderness, and cramping in his right thigh. During the game, he jumped up to tip a pass and landed awkwardly. His foot planted with his knee partly flexed and didn’t move.\r\n\r\nDr. Rooney examines Jamaal and diagnoses a partial tear of the right quadriceps muscle. She notes this is an initial visit. We already know that Tear directs us to Strain, which in turn directs us to Injury. So we’ll go straight to Injury this time and this code:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S76.111A, strain of right quadriceps muscle, fascia and tendon</li>\r\n	<li>Y92.321A, football field as the place of occurrence of the external cause</li>\r\n	<li>Y93.61, activity, American tackle football</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSo our team’s injury report is looking kind of grim. Anyone want to suit up?',

		'body' : 'Anytown hosted a national ICD-10 conference this week and some of the Fix ‘Em Up Clinic’s coders attended the sessions to learn all about the new coding system. The rest of us got to meet some of the faculty right here in the clinic. They did a site visit for the wrong reasons.\r\n\r\nOur first esteemed patient, Kim, came in two hours before her presentation complaining of abdominal pain radiating to her back, nausea, and a fever. Dr. Carroll documented that Kim has a history of kidney infections and upon examination diagnosed another one. He documented that she is not pregnant and did not recently give birth.\r\n\r\nWhen we look up “infection, kidney” in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index, we find a variety of choices:\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">kidney (cortex) (hematogenous) N15.9</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\">with calculus N20.0</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 90px;\">with hydronephrosis N13.6</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\">following ectopic gestation O08.89</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\">pelvis and ureter (cystic) N28.85</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\">puerperal (postpartum) O86.21</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\">specified NEC N15.8</p>\r\nWe know from Kim’s history that she was not pregnant recently, so we can eliminate some of the codes. Dr. Carroll also noted “no calculus and no cysts” so we can rule out a few more codes.\r\n\r\nStill, we need a little more information in order to select the correct code. When we reread Dr. Carroll’s note, we find the following diagnosis (naturally not where it should be in the documentation, but it is there):\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Chronic pyelonephritis associated with stricture of ureter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThat significantly narrows our choices to one:<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/sweating-woman-at-podium.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright  wp-image-3086\" title=\"sweating woman at podium\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/sweating-woman-at-podium-270x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"235\" height=\"260\" /></a>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>N11.1, chronic obstructive pyelonephritis</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nFortunately for Kim, she’ll be fine with antibiotics and made it back to the conference in time for her presentation.\r\n\r\nGetting to the lecture hall wasn’t a problem for Gloria. Her problem started when she got up to speak. According to her history, she came in complaining of heart palpitations, chest pain, tingling in her hands, difficulty breathing, and an upset stomach. She was convinced she was having a heart attack.\r\n\r\nFortunately, she just suffered a panic attack.\r\n\r\nGloria, however, was not comforted by Dr. Carroll’s diagnosis. She insisted she never panics. I’m going with Dr. Carroll on this one and reporting F41.0 (Panic disorder [episodic paroxysmal anxiety] without agoraphobia).\r\n\r\nOur final speaker, Pam, hobbled in after celebrating a little too much at the post-conference get-together. Pam tripped going down the stairs in the conference center and heard a snap, followed by excruciating pain. Well, followed by pain, the post-conference celebrations helped reduce the ouch factor.\r\n\r\nDr. Carroll sends Pam for x-rays, which confirm a broken foot. In order to code Pam’s broken foot, we need to scour Dr. Carroll’s documentation for the following information:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Which bone or bones did Pam fracture?</li>\r\n	<li>Is the fracture open or closed?</li>\r\n	<li>Is the fracture displaced or non-displaced?</li>\r\n	<li>Which foot did Pam break?</li>\r\n	<li>Encounter type: initial, subsequent, sequela</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBy reading Dr. Carroll’s documentation, we learn this is an initial visit for a displaced, closed fractures of the cuneiform and cuboid bones of the right foot.\r\n\r\nGreat, so we can code this, right? Not so fast.\r\n\r\nWe’re ready to code the fracture of the cuboid bone:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S92.211A, displaced fracture of cuboid bone of right foot, initial visit</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBut when we look up a fracture of the cuneiform bone, we find three choices because the foot contains three cuneiform bones:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Lateral</li>\r\n	<li>Intermediate</li>\r\n	<li>Medial</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nOh Dr. Carroll, we need some more information! And because Dr. Carroll quickly responds to our query, we find out that Pam actually broke two cuneiform bones—the lateral and the intermediate. That means we would report:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S92.221A, displaced fracture of lateral cuneiform of right foot, initial visit</li>\r\n	<li>S92.231A, displaced fracture of intermediate cuneiform of right foot, initial visit</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBy the way, if you look up “fracture, foot” in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index, it directs you to “fracture, tarsal” and the specific bone involved.\r\n\r\nBecause we are excellent coders who have read the entire code book (actually we know to check the notes at the front of each chapter), we know we also need to include secondary codes from Chapter 20 (external causes of morbidity) to indicate the cause of Pam’s injuries.\r\n\r\nFrom Dr. Carroll’s notes, we know she fell down stairs at a convention center. That leads us to codes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>W10.8xxA, fall (on) (from) other stairs and steps</li>\r\n	<li>Y92.29, other specified public building as the place of occurrence of the external cause</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAnd with that, the convention—and convention mishaps—are a wrap. I think I’ll stick to virtual events from now on.',

It’s a completely different system with a lot more detail than ICD-9-CM Volume 3. The biggest potential problem could be choosing the correct root operation.\r\n\r\nWithout the right root operation, coders can’t get to the correct code. And physicians don’t need to document a specific root operation name. It’s up to the coder to figure it out. (Thanks, guideline A11.)\r\n\r\nDetermining the root operation won’t always be easy because some root operations are very similar (excision and resection for example).\r\n\r\nSo what to do? Maybe we should follow Taiwan’s plan and make physicians document the specific root operation by name (good luck with that).\r\n\r\n<strong>Donna Smith, RHIA,</strong> a senior consultant with 3M, offered a better solution during our conversation at the AHIMA National Conference. Are you ready? Here it is:\r\n\r\nAsk the physician to explain the procedure to the coders.\r\n\r\nPull in one or two physicians from each specialty at your facility to talk to the coders. Make sure they’re nice, friendly docs who are willing to share information. Avoid the mean, grumpy docs.\r\n\r\nAsk the physician to walk through the operative notes for your organization’s most common procedures and explain to the coders what he or she is actually doing. What’s really going on in the operating room?\r\n\r\nOnce the coders know the intent of the procedure, they’ll have an easier time determining the root operation.\r\n\r\nYou can also do a little cross-training of the physicians. During the meeting, show the doc the ICD-10-PCS table for that particular procedure. That way, the physician can see what the coders need in the documentation.\r\n\r\nIf you use an EHR, collaborate with the physicians from each specialty to create a template they can use for their most common procedures. Smith suggested having physicians from each specialty drive their own templates. After all, a vascular surgeon will perform different procedures than a neurosurgeon, so they’ll need to document different information.\r\n\r\nAn added side bonus to this approach: you get clinicians and coders working together to improve documentation, which will make the transition easier for everyone.',

		'body' : '<strong></strong>Hurricane Sandy blasted the Mid-Atlantic region this week, causing plenty of destruction in its wake.  We could undoubtedly spend a lot of time coding for the injuries people suffered as a result of the hurricane/tropical storm—broken bones, contusions, lacerations, and so on.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/hurricane.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright  wp-image-3104\" title=\"hurricane\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/hurricane-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"260\" height=\"173\" /></a>Instead of the actual injuries, let’s look at some of the codes for external causes in ICD-10-CM. You probably know these better as ICD-9-CM E codes. They are the codes that explain how and where the patient suffered an injury.\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM contains a whole series of codes for cataclysmic storm (X37). All of these codes require a seventh character to denote the encounter type:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>A, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>D, subsequent encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S, sequela</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nMany also require one or two placeholders (X) so the character for the encounter ends up in the correct place in the code.\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>X37.0, hurricane</li>\r\n	<li>X37.1, tornado</li>\r\n	<li>X37.2, blizzard (snow)(ice)</li>\r\n	<li>X37.3, dust storm</li>\r\n	<li>X37.4, tidalwave</li>\r\n	<li>X37.8, other cataclysmic storm\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Cloudburst</li>\r\n	<li>Torrential rain</li>\r\n	<li>Excludes2: flood (X38)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>X37.9, unspecified cataclysmic storm\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Storm NOS</li>\r\n	<li>Excludes1: collapse of dam or man-made structure causing earth movement (X39.0)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nNotice this series includes both an “other” and an “unspecified” option. Even though ICD-10-CM includes unspecified codes, you should avoid using them as much as possible. One of the main reasons for moving to ICD-10 is for increased specificity. An unspecified code doesn’t give you that additional level of detail.\r\n\r\nThis series of codes also includes both types of Excludes notes.\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>An Excludes1 note means not coded here. Think of this as a pure excludes note. You should never report the excluded code with the code above the Excludes1 note.</li>\r\n	<li>An Excludes2 note means not included here. The condition excluded is not part of the condition under which it is listed, but a patient may have both conditions at the same time. So a patient could have suffered injuries as the result of both a flood and torrential rain. It’s okay to report both.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou might also see patients who have been exposed to fire as a result of the hurricane. More than 80 homes in Breezy Point, in New York City\'s Queens borough, burned during the storm.\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM includes codes to denote exposure to both an uncontrolled and a controlled fire. For exposure to uncontrolled fire in building or structure, select the appropriate code from series X00.\r\n\r\nNote that X00 codes also require a seventh character to denote the encounter, so you will need a placeholder again.\r\n\r\nThis series of codes also includes several different notes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Includes: conflagration in building or structure</li>\r\n	<li>Code first any associated cataclysm</li>\r\n	<li>Excludes2:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Exposure to ignition or melting of nightwear (X05)</li>\r\n	<li>Exposure to ignition or melting of other clothing and apparel (X06-)</li>\r\n	<li>Exposure to other specified smoke, fire and flames (X08.-)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIf the fire is uncontrolled, but not in a building or structure, choose a code from X01.',

		'body' : 'It’s All Saints Day (you know, the day after Halloween) and the waiting room at the Fix ‘Em Up Clinic is full of ghosties and ghoulies and long-legged beasties. I’m not sure if we have any things that go bump in the night, though.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Ghost.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright  wp-image-3107\" title=\"Ghost\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Ghost-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"242\" height=\"242\" /></a>Ghost Henry gobbled an incredible number of Snickers bars for breakfast this morning. While Snickers are generally not considered the breakfast of champions, they were almost Henry’s last meal.\r\n\r\nShortly after breakfast, Henry broke out in hives, started wheezing, and complained of tightness in his chest and a stomach ache. His mom brought him into Fix ‘Em Up, where Dr. Casper diagnoses anaphylactic shock due to a peanut allergy.\r\n\r\nSo what do we code first—anaphylactic shock or the peanut allergy?\r\n\r\nYou probably already know it’s the anaphylactic shock. That’s the reason for Henry’s visit today. Also, when you look up Allergy, peanut, in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index, the code listed is for status without reaction. If we were coding Henry’s medical history, we would note Z91.010 (allergy to peanuts).\r\n\r\nSince Henry is actually experiencing a reaction to his allergy, the anaphylactic shock, we would code:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>T78.01XA, anaphylactic reaction due to peanuts, initial visit</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nLike many ICD-10-CM codes T78.01 requires a seventh character for the encounter type. Dr. Casper documented an initial visit, hence the seventh character A. Don’t forget your sixth character placeholder. T78.01A is not a valid code and will result in a denial.\r\n\r\nWitch Sue is also in for overindulging in chocolate after a night of Trick-or-Treating. She didn’t suffer an allegoric reaction like Henry, but she did end up with a really bad bellyache.\r\n\r\nDr. Casper rules out an appendicitis and dyspepsia and diagnoses general abdominal pain due to overconsumption of candy.\r\n\r\nWhen we look up Pain, abdominal, in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index, we end up with a wide range of choices, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>R10.0, acute abdomen</li>\r\n	<li>R10.1, pain localized to upper abdomen</li>\r\n	<li>R10.3, pain localized to other parts of lower abdomen</li>\r\n	<li>R10.8, other abdominal pain</li>\r\n	<li>R10.9, unspecified abdominal pain</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nUnder R10.8, we find our choice based on the documentation of general abdominal pain:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>R10.84, generalized abdominal pain</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nGavin’s mom thought he would make a cute spider for Halloween, but Gavin’s coordination wasn’t up to the challenge of managing eight legs. One of the extra legs got in the way and sent him sprawling to the payment. At the same time, another leg caught him in the eye.\r\n\r\nHe ended up with a broken wrist and abrasions to his hand from trying to break his fall and a scratched cornea.\r\n\r\nWhat does Dr. Casper need to document for use to code these injuries?\r\n\r\nFor all three injuries, we need:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Laterality</li>\r\n	<li>Encounter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nFor the abrasions and the broken wrist, we need some additional specific details.\r\n\r\nWhere specifically on the hand are Gavin’s abrasions? Is it the palm, the fingers (and if so, which one[s])? It is the back of his hand? Does Gavin have any open wounds or punctures to go with the abrasions?\r\n\r\nFor the wrist fracture, we need to know:\r\n\r\nOpen or closed?\r\n\r\nDisplaced or non-displaced?\r\n\r\nHere’s what Dr. Casper documents:\r\n\r\n<em>Initial visit with 11-year-old male with multiple abrasions to right palm, right index finger, and right middle finger. No foreign bodies in wounds. Patient also suffered open fracture of right wrist with displacement of cuneiform and semilunar bones. Patient also suffered left corneal abrasion. He was trick-or-treating and tripped over his costume. He fell on a level surface (sidewalk) and did not strike any objects other than the sidewalk.</em>\r\n\r\nBased on that documentation, we would report codes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S62.111B, displaced fracture of triquetrum [cuneiform] bone, right wrist, initial visit</li>\r\n	<li>S62.121B, displaced fracture of lunate [semilunar], right wrist, initial visit</li>\r\n	<li>S60.511A, abrasion of right hand, initial visit</li>\r\n	<li>S60.410A, abrasion of right index finger, initial visit</li>\r\n	<li>S60.412A, abrasion of right middle finger, initial visit</li>\r\n	<li>S05.02XA, injury of conjunctiva and corneal abrasion without foreign body, left eye, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>W01.0XXA, fall on same level from slipping, tripping and stumbling without subsequent striking against object, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>Y93.01, activity, walking, marching and hiking</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSadly, ICD-10-CM does not include a code specific to trick-or-treating. Maybe next year.  For now, I’m off to enjoy the leftover candy in the breakroom.',

		'body' : 'Wile E. Coyote may bill himself as a Super Genius, but based on his last visit to the ACME ED, I think that’s overstating things a bit.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/tunnel.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright  wp-image-3114\" title=\"tunnel\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/tunnel-300x230.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"276\" height=\"211\" /></a>What landed Wile E. back in the ED, you ask? Another complicated, convoluted plan to snag a roadrunner lunch.\r\n\r\nIn this, um, ingenious plan, Wile E. painted a tunnel opening on a hillside to lure his lunch into his clutches. The only problem was, the “meep, meep” he thought meant food actually signaled a really large truck moving at a high rate of speed through Wile E.’s shortcut.\r\n\r\nThings didn’t end well for Wile E.\r\n\r\nThe ACME ambulance crew brought him in and (un)luckily for Wile E. (and for us), Dr. Fudd was on duty.  Dr. Fudd is not our top doc and he’s really bad at documentation.\r\n\r\nLet’s see what Dr. Fudd did document so we can figure out what additional information we need to code Wile E.’s injuries.\r\n\r\nFirst, Wile E. suffered multiple broken bones, which is not surprising since he was run over by a truck. For fractures we need to know:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Specific site (which bone and where on the bone)</li>\r\n	<li>Side (left or right)</li>\r\n	<li>Type of fracture (open or closed, displaced or non-displced)</li>\r\n	<li>Encounter (initial, subsequent, sequela)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIn reviewing the documentation, we note that Dr. Fudd documented this is an initial visit. That will give us our seventh character extension for the codes that require one.\r\n\r\nWile E.’s list of fractures includes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Broken leg</li>\r\n	<li>Broken ankle</li>\r\n	<li>Multiple rib fractures</li>\r\n	<li>Multiple foot fractures</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nFirst things first, which side are the fractures on? Keep in mind they can be on different sides, or even on both sides (in which case, we would report two different codes—one for the left side and one for the right).\r\n\r\nDr. Fudd documented that he sent Wile E. for x-rays for left-side fractures. Can we code from that documentation? No. We need Dr. Fudd to either specify that the fractures are on Wile E.’s left side or to document that he reviewed the radiology report of left-sided fractures.\r\n\r\nSo we’ll have query. But before we do, let’s make a list of all of the specific information we need so we only need to send a single query.\r\n\r\nAre Wile E.’s fractures open or closed? Dr. Fudd only documented the ribs as closed fractures, nothing about the leg and foot. That’s something else to add to our query.\r\n\r\nThe <em>2013 ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting</em> do give us a default on the question of open or closed as well as displaced or non-displaced. The guidelines state:\r\n\r\n<em>A fracture not indicated as open or closed should be coded to closed. A fracture not indicated whether displaced or not displaced should be coded to displaced.</em>\r\n\r\nHowever, ICD-10-CM does include specific seventh characters to denote types of open fractures. If we can obtain that information, we should because it will make the coding—and the medical record—more accurate.\r\n\r\nIn response to our query, Dr. Fudd documents the following:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Broken leg—transverse right tibia, shaft, class I Gustilo, displaced</li>\r\n	<li>Broken ankle—right medial malleolus and trimalleolar, both with dislocation, class II Gustilo</li>\r\n	<li>Multiple broken ribs—right side, closed</li>\r\n	<li>Multiple foot fractures—third, fourth, and fifth metatarsal, right foot, closed, non-displaced,</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe broken ribs are easy. We only have four choices—single or multiple, right or left. In this case, we would report:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S22.41XA, multiple fractures of ribs, right side, initial visit</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nOn to the rest of the fractures. By the way, did you notice all of the fractures are on the right side not the left like the x-ray order? It seems Dr. Fudd wrote an incorrect initial x-ray order. Fortunately, the radiologist pointed out the error and Dr. Fudd amended the order. He just didn’t include it in the record. (The radiologist, however, did.)\r\n\r\nFor the ankle and leg fractures, Dr. Fudd notes class I and class II Gustilo. If you don’t regularly work with traumatic fractures or orthopedics, you might not be familiar with the Gustilo-Anderson classification system. The Gustilo-Anderson classification identifies the severity of the soft tissue damage.\r\n\r\nIf you aren’t familiar with it, make sure your physicians are. And make sure they know to document it.\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM includes two different seventh characters for the initial visit of an open fracture:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>B, initial encounter for open fracture type I or II</li>\r\n	<li>C, initial encounter for open fracture type IIIA, IIIB, or IIIC</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nFor the open fractures, we would report:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S82.421B, displaced transverse fracture of shaft of right fibula, initial encounter for open fracture type I or II</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S82.51XB, displaced fracture of medial malleolus of right tibia, initial encounter for open fracture type I or II</li>\r\n	<li>S82.851B, displaced trimalleolar fracture of right lower leg, initial encounter for open fracture type I or II</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nNow we’re down to the foot fractures. Wile E. broke three metatarsals, so we need these three codes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S92.334A, nondisplaced fracture of third metatarsal bone, right foot, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S92.344A, nondisplaced fracture of fourth metatarsal bone, right foot, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S92.354A, nondisplaced fracture of fifth metatarsal bone, right foot, initial encounter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThat’s all for Wile E.’s broken bones. What other injuries did he suffer? According to Dr. Fudd’s  (somewhat sketchy) documentation, Wile E.’s only other injury is a lacerated spleen.\r\n\r\nHow big is the spleen laceration? The size of the laceration will determine which of these codes we report (with the appropriate seventh character to denote the encounter):\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S36.030, Superficial (capsular) laceration of spleen</li>\r\n	<li>S36.031, Moderate laceration of spleen</li>\r\n	<li>S36.032, Major laceration of spleen</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe ICD-10-CM Tabular Index includes these size guidelines to help determine severity of the laceration:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Superficial—</strong>less than 1 cm</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Moderate</strong>—1 to 3 cm</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Major—</strong>greater than 3 cm</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nDr. Fudd documented a 2.3 cm lacteration, which gives us S36.031A.\r\n\r\nAnd with that, Wile E. hobbles out of the ED to hopefully order some takeout for dinner.',

		'body' : 'Do you know what you don’t know about ICD-10? Do you know where your knowledge gaps are? Unfortunately, the answer is probably no.\r\n\r\nMore than half of the people who responded to our completely unscientific poll on JustCoding said their organizations haven’t performed any coder assessments in preparation for ICD-10.\r\n\r\nI was a little surprised by that, especially when I looked back at the timelines AHIMA and AAPC put out in 2010 and 2011. Those guidelines recommended coders complete anatomy and physiology (A&amp;P) assessments by mid-2011 based on the October 1, 2013 implementation date.\r\n\r\nMove the implementation date forward one year to October 1, 2014, and you can also move those assessment target dates up a year. So coders should have completed assessments by mid-2012. It’s now November and 56% of respondents said their organizations had not yet conducted any coder assessments.\r\n\r\nWhat do you know now? How strong is your A&amp;P knowledge? Granted, human anatomy hasn’t changed in a really long time, but when did you last actually review anatomy? Did you really know it or do you assume you do because you took A&amp;P when you became a coder?\r\n\r\nIf your organization hasn’t done a coder assessment, do one yourself. Identify which body systems you know well and which ones you know the least, recommends <strong>Gloryanne Bryant, BS, RHIA, RHIT, CCS, CDIP, CCDS,</strong> an HIM professional and leader for more than 30 years. Focus your training on your weakest areas, but don’t forget to review your stronger areas as well. Bryant also recommended determining how well you know the current coding guidelines. Most of them are going to stay the same in ICD-10. If you don’t know them now, start learning them. At the very least, review the guidelines. They change almost every year. Again, maybe not a lot, but you still need to stay on top of those changes.\r\n\r\nUntil you know where your knowledge gaps are, you can’t create an education plan. That’s true for individual coders and for organizations as a whole. Without a solid foundation in A&amp;P, medical terminology, and pathophysiology, you won’t succeed in ICD-9, let alone ICD-10.',

		'body' : 'Quite a few campers took advantage of the nice weather this weekend to make one last trip into the woods before winter. Unfortunately, some of them ended up in Fix ‘Em Up Clinic as a result of their adventures.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/camp-fire.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright  wp-image-3126\" title=\"camp fire\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/camp-fire-263x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"216\" height=\"247\" /></a>So let’s see who our unhappy campers are and what injuries they suffered.\r\n\r\nFirst we have Rick, who flashed back to his scouting days and decided to start a fire with flint and steel. He would have been better off using matches. While striking the flint and steel together to create a spark, he actually created a sliver of flint, which ended up in his eye. Along the way, it sliced into his lower eyelid.\r\n\r\nApparently our ICD-10 training hints are getting through to some of the Fix ‘Em Up physicians. Dr. Huckleberry documents a 0.5 cm laceration to the lower left eyelid and an ocular laceration ofthe left eyeball. Dr. Huckleberry documents that the flint chip is still in Rick’s eye and also documents this is an initial visit.\r\n\r\nSo we have laterality and encounter for this patient.  For the laceration, we need to know whether Rick suffered a prolapse or loss of intraocular tissue. When we go back to Dr. Dingleberry’s notes, we see that Rick did not suffer a prolapse or tissue loss. That leads us to codes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S01.112A, laceration without foreign body of left eyelid and periocular area, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S05.32XA, ocular laceration without prolapse or loss of intraocular tissue, left eye, initial encounter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nTwo things to note with the ocular laceration code: the code is only five characters long, so we need to add a placeholder (X) so our seventh character for encounter ends up in the correct place. Also, we don’t actually need to know whether the foreign body is still in the eye in order to code the laceration.\r\n\r\nWe can also add some codes from Chapter 20 (external causes of morbidity) as well, if our payer wants them. When we review Dr. Dingleberry’s notes, we learn that Rick’s injuries occurred :\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>At a campsite (Y92.833, campsite as the place of occurrence of the external cause)</li>\r\n	<li>During the building of a campfire (X03.4XXA, hit by object due to controlled fire, not in building or structure, initial encounter)</li>\r\n	<li>When he was struck by flint (W20.8XXA, other cause of strike by thrown, projected or falling object, initial encounter)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe camp fire also proved to be dangerous to fellow camper Chuck. Rick used porous rocks to build the stone circle around the fire and the rock exploded. Chuck found himself in the path of the flying debris and now has some lovely lacerations and burns to show for it.\r\n\r\nDr. Huckleberry documents an initial visit for lacerations to the:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Right index finger</li>\r\n	<li>Right palm (multiple lacerations)</li>\r\n	<li>Right forearm (multiple lacerations)</li>\r\n	<li>Left cheek</li>\r\n	<li>Forehead</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nFor these lacerations, we need to know if the exploding rock shards remained in the wound. Dr. Huckleberry helpfully documented that he found rock shards in all of the lacerations. We also need to know if the flying rocks damaged Chuck’s nails. (Dr. Huckleberry’s notes say no).\r\n\r\nThat give us codes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S61.220A, laceration with foreign body of right index finger without damage to nail, initial visit</li>\r\n	<li>S61.421A, laceration with foreign body of right hand, initial visit</li>\r\n	<li>S51.821A, laceration with foreign body of right forearm, initial visit</li>\r\n	<li>S01.422A, laceration with foreign body of left cheek and temporomandibular area, initial visit</li>\r\n	<li>S01.82XA, laceration with foreign body of other part of head, initial encounter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nRemember, “other part of the head” does not mean an unspecified part of the head. There are unspecified codes if you really must use one, but query first for a more precise location.\r\n\r\nAlso note the specificity in the finger laceration codes. ICD-10-CM includes separate codes for each finger for the left and right hands. In addition, the codes specify whether any foreign bodies remain in the lacerations.\r\n\r\nWe’ve got Chuck’s cuts coded, now let’s see what else is in the documentation that we need to report. Dr. Huckleberry’s notes indicate that Chuck suffered second-degree burns to his right arm, so we report:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>T22.211A, burn of second degree of right forearm, initial encounter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe are also instructed to use additional external cause code to identify the source, place and intent of the burn (X00-X19, X75-X77, X96-X98, Y92).\r\n\r\nWe know that Chuck was struck by exploding rock fragments at a campsite and the injuries were accidental, so we can rule out codes in the X75-77 range (intentional self-harm) and the X96-98 range (assault).\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM does not include a code for exploding campfire rocks.\r\n\r\nOur additional codes are:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>W20.8XXA, other cause of strike by thrown, projected or falling object, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>X03.4XXA, hit by object due to controlled fire, not in building or structure, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>Y92.833, campsite as the place of occurrence of the external cause</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nArthur, the third member of the camping expedition, missed all of the campfire fun. Arthur consumed too many adult beverages trying to, ahem, stay hydrated and instead need to head for the trees. Sadly, Arthur picked the wrong place to answer the call of nature. On his way to the perfect spot to relieve his bladder, he tore down a spider web and stumbled into some poison oak. The spider, completely unsympathetic to Arthur’s oncoming rash, decided to extract revenge for the web decimation by biting Arthur repeatedly.\r\n\r\nDr. Huckleberry documented allergic contact dermatitis due to poison oak, which gives us:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>L23.7, allergic contact dermatitis due to plants, except food</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWhat about the spider bites? Arthur did not notice what kind of spider bit him (he was otherwise occupied at the time). However, he is exhibiting toxic effects from the bites. Since we don’t know what kind of spider was responsible, we can code:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>T63.301, toxic effect of unspecified spider venom, accidental (unintentional)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIn some cases, you can determine the type of spider involved, in part by geography. ICD-10-CM contains specific codes for bites by a:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Black widow spider</li>\r\n	<li>Tarantula</li>\r\n	<li>Brown recluse spider</li>\r\n	<li>Other spider</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nEach type of toxic effect includes subcategories for:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Accidental (unintentional)</li>\r\n	<li>Intentional self-harm</li>\r\n	<li>Assault</li>\r\n	<li>Undetermined</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAll of this reminds me why I avoid roughing it!',

We all know physicians are busy people. So how do you get them engaged in learning about the increased specificity (and additional documentation needed) in ICD-10?\r\n\r\nFirst of all, don’t tell them everything. They don’t need to know and more importantly, they don’t care. A cardiologist doesn’t need to know that the ED physician has to document the Glascow Coma Scale.\r\n\r\n“Unless you have a physician who wants to go into the weeds—and there are a lot of weeds in coding—only give them the information the need,” says , Melody W. Mulaik,  MSHS, CPC, CPC-H, RCC, PCS, FCS President and Co-Founder of Coding Strategies, Inc. and Coding Metrix, Inc. located in Atlanta, GA .\r\n\r\nBe prepared to tell them why it’s important—better data, better patient care.\r\n\r\nAnd avoid scaring them just because you can. “Not everything is a crisis,” Mulaik says.\r\n\r\nWhile you’re at, leave your gunslinger outfit at home. “Don’t go into the staff meeting with your guns blazing,” warns<strong> Scot Nemchik CCS, CIRCC, </strong>AHIMA-Approved ICD-10 Trainer, and vice president of coding compliance and education for IOD, Inc., in Green Bay, Wis. You’ll lose the hearts and minds of your audience in a hurry that way.\r\n\r\nMake this a collaborative effort. Ask the physicians for their input. Respect their time. Remember that they have a short attention span when it comes to coding.\r\n\r\nAnd if they’re already doing something right—like including laterality—make sure you tell that that too. A little praise could go a long way towards making your life easier.',

		'body' : 'Do you find yourself wondering how you will ever learn everything to be ready for the ICD-10-CM/PCS compliance deadline?  Does it feel overwhelming with how busy you are? The answer: Keep Calm and Carry On.\r\n\r\nDuring World War II this was a well- loved British motto. Keep Calm and Carry On was printed on large bright red and white poster and distributed for display. The daily bombings unnerved the general population and the government instructed them to Keep Calm and Carry On to get through the chaos and keep day to day life functional. Certainly ICD-10 is not comparable to World War II. Nonetheless, “Keep Calm and Carry On” seems to be good advice for the months ahead.\r\n\r\nConsider tackling ICD-10 CM by chapter. Focus on the new changes in each chapter:\r\n\r\nChapter 1: Infectious and Parasitic Diseases (A00-B99)\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Some category, subcategories, and terminology used have changed. For example, ICD-9-CM code 008-Intestinal infections due to other organism will be A08, Viral and other specified intestinal infections in ICD-10-CM.</li>\r\n	<li>Certain diseases have been rearranged. For example, a separate subchapter or block has been created for infections with predominantly sexual mode of transmission (A50-A64) and separate blocks have been created for viral hepatitis (B15-B19) and other viral diseases (B25-B34).</li>\r\n	<li>The term sepsis has replaced septicemia.</li>\r\n	<li>Streptococcal sore throat and its inclusion terms are reclassified in ICD-10 to Chapter 10: Diseases of the Respiratory System.</li>\r\n	<li>Many codes have been expanded to reflect manifestations of the disease with the use of fourth or fifth characters allowing the infectious disease and manifestation to be captured in one code instead of two.</li>\r\n	<li>New coding guideline I.C.1.c. (infections resistant to antibiotics) instructs coders to assign code Z16 for infection with drug resistance to microorganisms following the infection code.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nNext week I will highlight the changes in ICD-10-CM Chapter 2 Neoplasm (C00-D49).',

		'body' : 'Over the river and through the woods to the Fix ‘Em Up Clinic we go.\r\n\r\nNot exactly where our patients want to spend Thanksgiving (and neither do we), but we’re here to coding their holiday mishaps.\r\n\r\nFirst is Sarah, who thought it was a good idea to text with her cousin Regina on the way to Grandmother’s house. Fortunately, she was driving slowly on a residential street when she hit a parked (unoccupied) car.\r\n\r\nSarah sustained some minor injuries, including contusions to her chest from the airbag, a sprained wrist, and a broken nose. She also lost her cell phone privileges and her insurance company is going to want to talk about new rates.\r\n\r\nDr. Gobbler sees Sarah and her documentation includes the following:\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">17-year-old female patient, see for initial visit following motor vehicle accident … Patient suffered contusions to right front wall of thorax caused by air bag … right radial carpal joint sprain, review of x-rays indicates closed hairline non-displaced fracture of distal pole of scaphoid bone … patient suffered closed nasal fracture.</p>\r\nBased on this documentation, we’re in good shape to code Sarah’s injuries. We know the:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Encounter</li>\r\n	<li>Laterality of the wrist sprain and fracture</li>\r\n	<li>Specific wrist bone fractured and location of the fracture (we have three choices for fractures of the scaphoid bone depending on the specific site of the fracture)</li>\r\n	<li>Specific joint sprained (we have four choices for a wrist sprain depending on which joint is injured)</li>\r\n	<li>Type of fracture (closed, non-displaced)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nOur codes would be:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S62.014A, nondisplaced fracture of distal pole of navicular [scaphoid] bone of right wrist, initial visit</li>\r\n	<li>S63.521A, sprain of radiocarpal joint of right wrist, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S20.211A, contusion of right front wall of thorax</li>\r\n	<li>S02.2XXA, fracture of nasal bones, initial visit</li>\r\n	<li>V53.5XXA, driver of pick-up truck or van injured in collision with car, pick-up truck, or van in traffic accident, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>W22.11XA, striking against or struck by the driver side automobile airbag, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>Y92.414, local residential or business street as the place of occurrence of the external cause</li>\r\n	<li>Y93.C2, activity, hand held interactive electronic device</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nICD-10 only includes one code (S02.2) for a nasal fracture. However, that code requires a seventh character, which gives you six possible codes. Don’t forget to add two “X” placeholders to move the encounter to the seventh character place. Otherwise, your code is invalid.\r\n\r\nWhile most of us still put our bird in the oven on Thanksgiving, Dennis decided to try something different. He went for the deep fried turkey. Not such a good choice as it turns out.\r\n\r\nDennis claims that when he attempted to put his Butterball turkey into the hot oil, the bird jumped out, splattering the aforementioned oil in its wake. As a result, Dennis suffered second degree burns to his arm, side of his neck, and side of his face.\r\n\r\nDr. Gobbler documents the following:\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">36-year-old male patient presents with second degree burns to left forearm, left neck area, and left check …patient suffered third degree burns to left index and middle fingers … initial encounter ... patient accidentally burned by cooking oil while attempting to deep fry turkey outside on patio of single-family residence … patient suffered no additional injuries.</p>\r\nICD-10-CM codes do not specify the size of the burn, just the degree. And some of the codes include multiple areas. So even though Dr. Gobbler documented burns on five sites, we only need the following three codes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>T23.242A, burn of second degree of multiple left fingers (nail), including thumb, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>T22.212A, burn of second degree of left forearm, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>T20.29XA, burn of second degree of multiple sites of head, face, and neck</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe burn codes all feature the following note:\r\n\r\nUse additional external cause code to identify the source, place and intent of the burn (X00-X19, X75-X77, X96-X98, Y92)\r\n\r\nSo we need to add:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>X10.2XXA, contact with fats and cooking oils, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>Y92.018, other place in single-family (private) house as the place of occurrence of the external cause</li>\r\n	<li>Y93.G3, activity, cooking and baking</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSince Dennis’ burns were accidentally self-inflicted, we don’t need an assault code (X96-X98) or an intentional self-harm code (X75-X77).\r\n\r\nThe bird did not get far however. Dennis’ wife found it “hiding” on the roof of the garage. She decided to dump Dennis at Fix ‘Em Up Clinic and head for a restaurant for dinner.\r\n\r\nThat sounds like a good plan to me.

Dr. Carroll must include that information in his documentation</li>\r\n	<li>Specific ligament ruptured –collateral ligament, radiocarpal, ulnocarpal, or other. Other doesn’t not mean unspecified. ICD-10-CM does include a code for unspecified ligament, but we want to avoid unsing unspecified unless absolutely necessary.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWe do know the knee contusions are bilateral because Dr. Carroll documented knees.\r\n\r\nLet’s see what additional information Dr. Carroll can provide about Heather’s injuries.\r\n\r\nIn response to our query, Dr. Carroll provides the following:\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Initial encounter for traumatic rupture of radiocarpal and collateral ligaments of right wrist; contusions to right hand, abrasions on left palm; contusions on both knees.</p>\r\nGreat, now we can report the following codes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S63.311A, traumatic rupture of collateral ligament of right wrist, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S63.321A, traumatic rupture of right radiocarpal ligament, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S60.221A, contusion of right hand, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S60.512A, abrasion of left hand, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S80.01XA, contusion of right knee, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S80.02XA, contusion of left knee, initial encounter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIf Heather had suffered injuries to her fingers in addition to the abrasions and contusions to her hands, we would need to code those injuries separately by the specific finger injured.\r\n\r\nWe can also report the following external causes codes if the payer wants them:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>W03.XXXA, other fall on same level due to collision with another person</li>\r\n	<li>Y92.59, other trade areas as the place of occurrence of the external cause (the mall)</li>\r\n	<li>Y93.01, activity, walking, marching and hiking</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSadly, ICD-10-CM does not yet include a code for door-buster shopping, or any shopping for that matter.\r\n\r\nOur next patient Rex really wanted that jersey at the sporting goods store in the mall, but unfortunately for him, someone else wanted it more. Rex arrived at Fix ‘Em Up with some pretty nasty bruises as well as a broken leg. The other guy really didn’t fight fair it seems.\r\n\r\nDr. Morang documents an initial visit for:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Contusions to the right periocular area</li>\r\n	<li>Closed, nondisplaced fracture of zygomatic arch (that explains the really nasty bruise on Rex’s face)</li>\r\n	<li>Laceration of the lower lip (no foreign body in wound)</li>\r\n	<li>Open displaced oblique fracture of shaft of right tibia (Gustilo class I)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nApparently Dr. Morang slept off the Thanksgiving turkey better than Dr. Carroll. With this documentation, we can code the following:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S82.231B, displaced oblique fracture of shaft of right tibia, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S00.11XA, contusion of right eyelid and periocular area, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S02.402, zygomatic fracture, unspecified, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S01.511A, laceration without foreign body of lip, initial encounter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nI think I’ll wait for Cyber Monday.

		'body' : 'When I first heard that the American Medical Association (AMA) is still fighting against ICD-10 implementation, I thought, “Seriously?” and rolled my eyes.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Cadusius.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright  wp-image-3159\" title=\"Cadusius\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Cadusius-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"256\" height=\"256\" /></a>In case you haven’t heard, the AMA’s House of Delegates again voted to oppose the implementation of ICD-10 during its 2012 Interim Meeting. This is the second time the House of Delegates has tried to stop ICD-10. Their first effort resulted in a one-year delay. I don’t think another delay is likely.\r\n\r\nChris Stahlecker from CMS’ Administrative Simplification Group of the Office of eHealth Standards and Services summed up the problem of not switching to ICD-10 during a recent CMS National Provider Call:\r\n\r\n“We just can\'t continue to exist on the ICD-9 codes…we cannot advance our healthcare delivery system based off of code values that are becoming obsolete and very complicated to convey any meaningful information,” Stahlecker said.\r\n\r\nMy friend Jennifer Avery, who is a regulatory specialist with HCPro, often complains about the lack of specificity in ICD-9 procedure codes. She’s fond of pointing out that coders report a central venous catheter insertion and a peripherally inserted central catheter with the same code (38.93). So how do you know what the physician actually did?\r\n\r\nThe AMA claims the switch to ICd-10 presents a “bureaucratic and financial burden on physicians.”\r\n\r\nThe AMA is probably right. The transition will require a considerable amount of resources—both personnel and financial.\r\n\r\nI get that physicians, practices, and hospitals have finite resources. My checkbook reminds me about finite resources every month.\r\n\r\nBut we can’t keep putting of the switch. Each year we wait, the costs go up, which in turn puts an even bigger burden on physicians, hospitals, and practices.\r\n\r\nThe AMA’s delegates may ask CMS to skip ICD-10 all together and move straight to ICD-11. That’s unlikely to happen.\r\n\r\nICD-11 codes aren’t ready yet, so no one knows for sure what they will look like. The beta version of the codes is expected in 2015, according to the World Health Organization. That’s one year after the US will finally transition to ICD-10, so on the surface it might seem like a good idea to wait an extra year.\r\n\r\nExcept it won’t be just one extra year. The codes probably won’t be ready for actual use for several years after beta testing begins. In its resolution, the AMA mentions October 17, 2017 as a possible date to begin using ICD-11.\r\n\r\nGiven how long it’s taken to get ICD-10 codes ready for use in the US, 2017 seems very optimistic for ICD-11.\r\n\r\nPart of the problem is too many people used fear as a motivator when CMS announced the switch to ICD-10. It seems like everyone focused on the number of new codes without really looking at the actual codes.\r\n\r\nYes, we’ll have a lot more codes in ICD-10, but physicians should already be documenting some of the information coders need. For example, laterality alone can quadruple code choices and it’s something physicians should already be reporting.\r\n\r\nIf a physician treats a patient for macular keratitis, the physician should be documenting which eye. In ICD-9, it doesn’t matter—coders only have one code: 370.22.\r\n\r\nIn ICD-10, coders will have four choices:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>H16.111, Macular keratitis, right eye</li>\r\n	<li>H16.112, Macular keratitis, left eye</li>\r\n	<li>H16.113, Macular keratitis, bilateral</li>\r\n	<li>H16.119, Macular keratitis, unspecified eye</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe only difference is laterality—specifically coding for the eye (or eyes) involved.\r\n\r\nNot every change is going to be that simple of course. Coding for diabetes and fractures will change significantly in ICD-10.\r\n\r\nPhysicians will need to document some things they aren’t documenting now. Some of that will be new information, some of it will be information they should be documenting now. If physicians documented correctly and appropriately now, we wouldn’t need clinical documentation improvement specialists.\r\n\r\nThe AMA also stands to lose a significant amount of money if CMS moves away from CPT coding and requires ICD-10-PCS codes for both inpatient and outpatient procedures. That idea has been tossed around quite a bit and in some ways makes sense.\r\n\r\nICD-10-PCS would need some additional codes, for services such as E&amp;M, but ICD-10-PCS has plenty of room to expand (unlike ICD-9). That potential financial hit probably also factors into the AMA’s opposition to ICD-10.\r\n\r\nWe’re moving to ICD-10 for the right reasons: better data and better patient care. I hope the AMA remembers that and stops fighting implementation.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;',

For example, ICD-10-CM will provide information about whether the neoplasm occurred in a right-sided or left-sided body part. Coders will still use the alphabetic index and tabular list for code assignment. The neoplasm table column for in situ will be next to the column for benign instead of being at the end of the columns.\r\n\r\nThe biggest sequencing difference is relates to anemia associated with malignancy.

The growth isn’t causing any functional problems, so we don’t need to report any additional ICD-10-CM codes.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/thyroid.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-3173\" title=\"thyroid\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/thyroid-300x217.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"217\" /></a>Penny’s doctor, Dr. Morang,  wants to remove the growth to make sure it doesn’t cause problems in the future.\r\n\r\nWhen we code the procedure in ICD-10-PCS, we need to know several key pieces of information.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, we need to know what exactly Dr. Morang is removing:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Just the benign growth</li>\r\n	<li>Part of Penny’s thyroid</li>\r\n	<li>Penny’s full thyroid</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThat will determine which root operation we will use to build our code.\r\n\r\nIf Dr. Morang is removing the growth only, we would use root operation Extirpation (taking or cutting out solid matter from a body part).\r\n\r\nIf Dr. Morang is removing part of Penny’s thyroid, we would use root operation Excision (cutting out of off, without replacement, a portion of a body part).\r\n\r\nIn this case, Dr. Morang plans to remove Penny’s entire thyroid, so we need to consider other root operations.\r\n\r\nHere’s where we need to look for a second piece of information: how is Dr. Morang removing Penny’s thyroid?\r\n\r\nIs he cutting it out? Ripping it out (let’s hope not, that sounds painful)? Using energy, force, or a destructive agent?\r\n\r\nDr. Morang’s operative note states he excised the thyroid using a sharp instrument. So that eliminates several more root operations:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Destruction (physical eradication of all or a portion of a body part by the direct use of energy, force, or a destructive agent)</li>\r\n	<li>Extraction (pulling or stripping out or off all or a portion of a body part by the use of force)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThat leaves us with Resection (cutting out or off, without replacement, all of a body part).\r\n\r\nNote that we’ll use Resection even though Dr. Morang documented Excision. Physicians do not need to use the root operation in their dictation. It’s up to the coder to determine the correct root operation based on the intent of the procedure. In this case, the intent is to remove the entire thyroid, so the root operation is Resection.\r\n\r\nWe can start building our code based on what we know so far: Resection of the thyroid will fall under the Medical and Surgical section of ICD-10-PCS, so our first character is 0.\r\n\r\nThe thyroid is part of the endocrine system, so our second character is G.\r\n\r\nDr. Morang is performing a Resection, which makes our third character T.\r\n\r\nNow we can go to the ICD-10-PCS table for 0GT and see what else we need to know to complete the code.\r\n\r\nWe already know he is removing the thyroid, which makes our fourth character K. If he was only removing one lobe of Penny’s thyroid, we would use either G (left lobe) or H (right lobe).\r\n\r\nFor our fifth character, we need to know what kind of approach Dr. Morang used and the table offers only two choices:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Open (0)</li>\r\n	<li>Percutaneous endoscopic (4)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nDr. Morang documented an open procedure. This particular procedure only has two approaches, but other procedures can be performed using additional approaches. Make sure the physician documented how he or she performed the procedure.\r\n\r\nWe still need two more characters to complete our code, but luckily we don’t need any additional information. The only choices for the sixth and seventh characters are Z (no device and no qualifier).\r\n\r\nThat gives us a final ICD-10-PCS code of 0GTK0ZZ (resection of thyroid gland, open approach).\r\n\r\nDr. Morang declared Penny’s surgery a success and sends her home. Since we have both a diagnosis code and a procedure code, we can send off the bill as well.',

In some cases, coders can construct more than 200 possible codes from a single table.\r\n\r\nWithin the various sections of ICD-10-PCS, each character of the seven-character alphanumeric code identifies ‘specific’ or ‘general’ values.\r\n\r\nIn the Medical &amp;Surgical section, if separate body part (character 4) values exist, then coders must report multiple codes.\r\n\r\nFor example, if a physician performed an open total abdominal hysterectomy (removing both the uterus and the cervix), we would look at root operation Resection <em>(</em>cutting out or off, without replacement, all of a body part) in the alphabetic index.

The physician will need to document tissue necrosis.\r\n\r\nThe next thing we need to know is the specific location or locations where the frostbite occurred. We also need to know the encounter so we can report the appropriate seventh character.\r\n\r\nLet’s look at Dr. Frost’s notes and see if we have enough information to code Moe’s frostbite:\r\n\r\n<em>39-year-old male seen for initial treatment of frostbite…three toes on right foot show frostbite with tissue necrosis…right ankle shows frostbite with some skin loss, but no necrosis…lower right leg superficial frostbite. Patient also has frostbite with tissue necrosis of left index, middle, and ring fingers and superficial frostbite of left hand.</em>\r\n\r\nBased on this note we know we are coding for five areas of frostbite:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Toes of the right foot</li>\r\n	<li>Right ankle</li>\r\n	<li>Right lower leg</li>\r\n	<li>Index, middle, and ring fingers of left hand</li>\r\n	<li>Left hand</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe also know the degree of frostbite at each site and the encounter, so we can code:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>T34.831A, frostbite with tissue necrosis of right toe(s), initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>T34.532A, frostbite with tissue necrosis of left finger(s), initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>T33.811A, superficial frostbite of right ankle, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>T33.71A, superficial frostbite of right knee and lower leg, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>T33.522A, superficial frostbite of left hand, initial encounter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nOne thing to note about the frostbite codes: the codes for the fingers and toes do not require the physician to specify which or how many fingers and toes are involved. The codes currently read finger(s) and toe(s) with no further specificity.\r\n\r\nMoe’s friend Larry joined him at deer camp and at the Fix ‘Em Up Clinic. Larry, being the more dedicated hunter, was up in a tree stand and fell asleep. He then fell out of the tree stand and was impaled by a deer’s antlers. The unlucky deer apparently was checking out the tree where Larry placed his stand.\r\n\r\nBambi sadly is a goner after suffering a crush injury to the skull (Larry being a big guy), but Larry survived with a puncture wound to the abdomen.\r\n\r\nIn order to code Larry’s injury, we need to know:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Where specifically the puncture wound occurred—right or left side, upper or lower quadrant</li>\r\n	<li>Whether the puncture penetrated to the peritoneal cavity</li>\r\n	<li>Whether any piece of the antler remained in the wound</li>\r\n	<li>Encounter type—initial, subsequent, sequela</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nDr. Frost documents the following:\r\n\r\n<em>41-year-old male patient seen for initial visit of penetrating injury to lower right quadrant of abdomen.,, piece of antler stuck in abdominal wall, no penetration into peritoneal cavity.</em>\r\n\r\nThat leads us to:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S31.143A, puncture wound of abdominal wall with foreign body, right lower quadrant without penetration into peritoneal cavity, initial encounter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nFortunately, Larry suffered no other injuries and is expected to recover.\r\n\r\nOur final deer camp refugee, Curly, came in complaining of pain he describes as \"piercing needles in the skin.\" He also sports a rash with blisters along his right side and stated he experienced chills, stomachache, and diarrhea two days before the rash appears.\r\n\r\nDr. Frost examines Curly and learns he had chickenpox as a child. Curly’s current condition relates back to that childhood malady. He is suffering from shingles, not a condition related to his stay at the deer camp.\r\n\r\nWhen we look up shingles in the ICD-10-CM alphabetic index, we are directed to see herpes, zoster. Sadly that is not the end of our diagnostic quest. The ICD-10-CM tabular list breaks herpes zoster down into seven subcategories:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>B02.0, zoster encephalitis</li>\r\n	<li>B02.1, zoster meningitis</li>\r\n	<li>B02.2, zoster with other nervous system involvement</li>\r\n	<li>B02.3, zoster ocular disease</li>\r\n	<li>B02.7, disseminated zoster</li>\r\n	<li>B02.8, zoster with other complications</li>\r\n	<li>B02.9, zoster without complications</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nHmm, we may need to ask Dr. Frost for some clarifying information. When we query, Dr. Frost states zoster without complications, so we code B02.9.\r\n\r\nSo Moe, Larry, and Curly are on their way (hopefully not back to deer camp) and I feel a sudden need to avoid the woods. Bambi’s brothers might be out for revenge.',

		'body' : 'We’ve already discussed one of the multiple procedure guidelines in ICD-10-PCS, but we still have three more to go. And that’s not counting the guidelines that are not included in the multiple procedure section.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/guidelines1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright  wp-image-3188\" title=\"guidelines\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/guidelines1-300x170.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"219\" height=\"124\" /></a>Now let’s look at what happens when a provider performs procedures on multiple body sites in the same body part value during the same operative session.\r\n\r\nThe medical and surgical section of ICD-10-PCS includes 31 body systems, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Central nervous system (second character 0)</li>\r\n	<li>Eye (8)</li>\r\n	<li>Bursae and ligaments (M)</li>\r\n	<li>Lower joints (S)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThat’s not the complete list obviously, but it gives you an idea.\r\n\r\nEach body system is then further broken down into body parts and those parts vary by system. For example, under bursae and ligaments, you find:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Head and neck bursa and ligament (fourth character 0)</li>\r\n	<li>Shoulder bursa and ligament, right (1)</li>\r\n	<li>Shoulder bursa and ligament, left  (2)</li>\r\n	<li>Elbow bursa and ligament, right (3)</li>\r\n	<li>Elbow bursa and ligament, left (4)</li>\r\n	<li>Wrist bursa and ligament, right (5)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAnd so on. Again this isn’t an exhaustive list, bursea and ligaments contain 27 possible fourth characters.\r\n\r\nSo if the physician performs a procedure on two different body parts, say the right wrist and the right elbow, the codes will be different because you have a different body part. The payer can clearly see your physician performed two distinct services.\r\n\r\nWhat happens when a surgeon repairs a torn left posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) and a left lateral collateral ligament (LCL) by open approach during the same operative session? Both ligaments are coded to the body part of knee bursa and ligament. However, they are not the same ‘site.’\r\n\r\nThe ICD-10-PCS guidelines instruct coders to report multiple procedures if the same root operation repeated at different body sites that are included in the same body part value during the same operative session.\r\n\r\nIn this case, we must report the procedure code twice to identify ‘two’ sites were repaired:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>0MQP0ZZ for the left PCL repair</li>\r\n	<li>0MQP0ZZ for the left LCL repair</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nHow does the payer know we really repaired two separate sites and that it isn’t just a clerical error in reporting?\r\n\r\nEveryone in the outpatient world is saying, add a modifier! And if we were coding in CPT, that’s exactly what we would do. However, ICD-10-PCS currently does not include anything that would help to identify that these are actually two sites.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, ICD-10-PCS doesn’t have anything to differentiate the two ligaments, but we’re still more than 18 months away from implementation. Something could change between now and October 1, 2014. But if it doesn’t you still have to follow the guidelines and report the code twice.',

My biggest challenge in this chapter is understanding the terminology and physiology.  There are so many types of anemia and immunologic disorders.  The documentation specificity for these is not always available.\r\n\r\nChapter 3 contains the following blocks:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>D50-D53, nutritional anemias</li>\r\n	<li>D55-D59, hemolytic anemias</li>\r\n	<li>D60-D64, aplastic and other anemias and other bone marrow</li>\r\n	<li>D65-D69, coagulation defects, purpura and other hemorrhagic conditions</li>\r\n	<li>D70-D77, other disorders of blood and blood-forming organs</li>\r\n	<li>D78, intraoperative and postprocedural complications of spleen</li>\r\n	<li>D80-D89, certain disorders involving the immune mechanism</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nI don’t have enough room in this blog to review the diseases and disorders in this chapter.  The terminology and physiology of this chapter are an example of why coders need to have completed a course in anatomy and physiology before they start training for ICD-10.\r\n\r\nIn Chapter 3:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Terminology has been updated</li>\r\n	<li>Classification changes have been made that provide greater specificity</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIn addition, the last block of codes in this chapter groups disorders involving the immune mechanism.\r\n\r\nPay careful attention to coding guideline I.C. 2.c.1 (anemia associated with malignancy)\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>When admission/encounter is for management of an anemia associated with the malignancy, and the treatment is only for the anemia, the appropriate code for the malignancy is sequenced as the principal or first listed diagnosis followed by the code D63.0 anemia in neoplastic disease. </em></p>\r\nThis guideline will increase approximately 2.25 cents per $100 for MS-DRG 812 reimbursement.  When the admission is for management of anemia associated with malignancy and the treatment is only for the anemia, report the appropriate code for malignancy first followed by code D63.0 (anemia in neoplastic disease).   In ICD-9-CM, coders sequence the anemia first.  Under ICD-10 with the malignancy coded first, this shifts these cases into generally higher paying cancer MS-DRGs.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;',

		'body' : 'Moderation is not a term usually associated with the holiday season, as you can see from the waiting room at Fix ‘Em Up Clinic.\r\n\r\nClark spent two days stringing holiday lights over everything: his tree, his house, his yard, even a <a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/deer-with-lights.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-3202\" title=\"deer with lights\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/deer-with-lights-298x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"298\" height=\"300\" /></a>reindeer who wandered too close. After putting up literally thousands of lights, Clark thought he’d plug them all in at once. Sadly, Clark did not check his wiring before plugging in the lights and instead of getting a festive display, Clark got lit up himself.\r\n\r\nFortunately he also blew a fuse, so his electric shock was brief and left no real lasting damage.\r\n\r\nWhen we look up “electric shock” in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index, we’re directed to T75.4, electrocution. Technically electrocution and electric shock are two different things. For coding purposes, however, shock from electric current is included under T75.4.\r\n\r\nNote that we also need a seventh character for this code to denote encounter type. Dr. Clause documented an initial visit, so we would code T75.4XXA. We need the two Xs as placeholders so the seventh character shows up in the seventh position in the code.\r\n\r\nOur next patient, Susan, attempted to hang mistletoe in a very out of the way place—the ceiling of the rec room in her single-family home. She thought it would be fun to see who she could surprise into kissing. However, her reach exceeded her grasp (and the height of her ladder) and instead of attaching mistletoe, she took a tumble.\r\n\r\nDr. Clause documents:\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Initial visit for a fall from a ladder.  Patient tore calcaneofibular and tibiofibular ligaments of left ankle. Patient suffered transscaphoid-perilunate fracture dislocation of left wrist.</p>\r\nSusan has two distinct injuries—one to the ankle and one to the wrist. We know this is an initial visit, so we’ll use seventh character A on the injury codes. Let’s start with Susan’s left ankle.\r\n\r\nDr. Clause documents torn ligaments. When we look up Torn in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index, it directs us to Tear, which in turn directs us to Sprain. If you know a torn ligament is the same as a sprain, you can start at sprain.\r\n\r\nUnder Sprain, ankle, we find six different options, each specifying the ligament involved. Note that one of the options is specified ligament NEC—meaning not elsewhere classified. Make sure you only use this code if the physician documents the actual ligament involved, but ICD-10-CM doesn’t have a code for that ligament. If the physician failed to document the ligament, send a query.\r\n\r\nDr. Clause documented the ligaments involved: calcaneofibular and tibiofibular. We would report:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S93.412A, sprain of calcaneofibular ligament of left ankle, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S93.432A, sprain of tibiofibular ligament of left ankle, initial encounter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThat takes care of the ankle, now on to the wrist. Unless you regularly code orthopedics, you may not know what a transscaphoid-perilunate fracture dislocation is.\r\n\r\nHere’s where it pays to have a good relationship with a physician, nurse, clinical documentation improvement specialist, or an orthopedic coder.\r\n\r\nAccording to Medscape:\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">A perilunate fracture dislocation involves traumatic rupture of the radioscaphocapitate ligament, the scapholunate interosseous ligament, and the lunotriquetral interosseous ligament. Fractures of the radial styloid, the scaphoid, the trapezium, the capitate, and the triquetrum also may be associated with the dorsal or the volar perilunate dislocation.</p>\r\nWe know that the scaphoid bone is fractured, hence transscaphiod in the description of the injury. But is it an open or closed fracture, displaced or non-displaced, which specific part of the bone fractured? Are any other bones fractured?\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we need to make sure all three ligaments—radioscaphocapitate, scapholunate interosseous, and lunotriquetral interosseous—are indeed ruptured.\r\n\r\nIn response to our query, Dr. Clause confirms the traumatic rupture of all three ligaments and documents the fracture as closed, non-displaced fracture of the proximal third of the scaphoid bone.\r\n\r\nOff to the Alphabetic Index we go to look up rupture, traumatic, wrist. This time we are looking for a traumatic rupture, not just a sprain. That’s important because traumatic ruptures have their own codes. However, when we look up those codes (S63.30), we find that ICD-10-CM does not yet include specific codes for radioscaphocapitate, scapholunate interosseous, and lunotriquetral interosseous ligaments.\r\n\r\nThat means we have to report one code three times:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S63.392A, traumatic rupture of other ligament of left wrist, initial encounter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe still have time before the ICD-10-CM codes go into use in the US, so the cooperating parties may add additional codes for the specific ligaments. Otherwise, report it three times, but be aware that your payer may question it.\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM does not list the scaphoid as one of the bones of the wrist in the alphabetic index. The scaphoid is also called the carpal navicular bone and that’s what you’ll find the code. So we would report:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S62.032A, displaced fracture of proximal third of navicular [scaphoid] bone of left wrist, closed, initial encounter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe’re not quite done yet. We also need to code how Susan sustained her injuries.\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>W11.XXXA, fall on and from ladder, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>Y92.018A, other place in single-family (private) house as the place of occurrence of the external cause</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSo we have the how (falling from ladder) and the where, we just need to code what she was doing. Sadly for us, ICD-10-CM doesn’t include an activity code for decorating. So we need to choose the closest activity. My choice would be:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Y93.D9, activity, other involving arts and handcrafts</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nFeel free to disagree. Maybe we can get ICD-10-CM to add a decorating code.',

Generally, she’s pretty stable, but right now she’s very anxious. She complains about feeling keyed up, is unable to sleep, is extremely irritable, and has trouble remembering anything beyond her fear of the apocalypse.\r\n\r\nAfter evaluating Florence, Dr. Jones diagnoses Florence with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in addition to her bipolar disorder I. Dr. Jones lists her as being in a moderately depressive phase of her bipolar disorder without psychotic features.\r\n\r\nFor this visit, we would code:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>F41.1, generalized anxiety disorder</li>\r\n	<li>F31.32, bipolar disorder, current episode depressed, moderate</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nICD-10-CM only includes one code for generalize anxiety disorder, but offers a wide range of codes for bipolar disorder. When coding bipolar disorder, we need to know whether the:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Patient is in a manic or depressive phase</li>\r\n	<li>Bipolar disorder is active or in remission</li>\r\n	<li>Patient exhibits psychotic features</li>\r\n	<li>The mania or depression is mild, moderate, or severe</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nOur final patient for the day, Cassius, came in complaining of diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, fever, fatigue, and headache. When Dr. Jones took Cassius’ history, he learned that Cassius had spent the last three weeks living in a cave in the woods, hoping to avoid the end of the world. Instead, he contracted gastroenteritis.\r\n\r\nIn order to code the gastroenteritis, we need to know what type is it. If it is noninfectious, it could be:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Gastroenteritis and colitis due to radiation (pretty sure that’s out, but you never know)</li>\r\n	<li>Toxic gastroenteritis and colitis</li>\r\n	<li>Allergic and dietetic gastroenteritis and colitis</li>\r\n	<li>Other specified noninfective gastroenteritis and colitis</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIf it’s viral, it could be:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Acute gastroenteropathy due to Norwalk agent</li>\r\n	<li>Acute infections</li>\r\n	<li>Rotaviral</li>\r\n	<li>Specified type NOC</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nDr. Jones documents acute gastroenteropathy due to Norwalk agent, so we would code A08.11.

That’s the same information we need to code in ICD-9.\r\n\r\nDr. Donner documents chronic sinusitis of the maxillary, frontal, and ethmoidal sinuses, so we would report:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>J32.0, chronic maxillary sinusitis</li>\r\n	<li>J32.1, chronic frontal sinusitis</li>\r\n	<li>J32.2, chronic ethmoidal sinusitis</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nUnder J32 (chronic sinusitis) we also find a note instructing us to use additional<strong> </strong>code to identify:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (Z77.22)</li>\r\n	<li>exposure to tobacco smoke in the perinatal period (P96.81)</li>\r\n	<li>history of tobacco use (Z87.891)</li>\r\n	<li>infectious agent (B95-B97)</li>\r\n	<li>occupational exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (Z57.31)</li>\r\n	<li>tobacco dependence (F17.-)</li>\r\n	<li>tobacco use (Z72.0)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nRudolph is not exposed to any tobacco smoke and does not use any tobacco. However, Dr. Donner does not Staphylococcus aureus as the infectious agent. So we need to add code:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>B95.61, methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus infection as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nDr. Donner prescribes some awesome antibiotics for Rudolph and sends him on his way with orders to rest and not lead a sleigh.\r\n\r\nSanta is also in for his pre-flight checkup. Dr. Donner gives Santa a clean bill of health, so we would code:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Z00.00, encounter for general adult medical examination without abnormal findings</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAnd I heard him exclaim as he exited the clinic, Merry Christmas to all, we’ll be off in a minute!',

That was all fine and well until his younger brother Eric decided to see how many Legos he could stuff in his nose.\r\n\r\nFortunately, Eric only managed one before his mother realized what he was up to and hustled him in to the Fix ‘Em Up Clinic.\r\n\r\nDr. Clause extracted the block and pronounced Eric good to go. Steve, however, deposited that block in the trash. No sense in using a block with his brother’s snot on it.\r\n\r\nIn order to code Eric’s mishap, we need to know the encounter type (in this case initial) and where exactly the block was located—in the nasal sinus or the nostril. Dr. Clause documents left nostril, so we would code:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>T17.1XXA, foreign body in nostril, initial encounter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBilly and Susie also suffered a mishap when they took Billy’s new sled to the top of Heartbreak Hill in Anytown’s public park  to try it out. Billy was not as good a sled driver as he claimed and as a result, they crashed into a tree.\r\n\r\nNeither suffered serious injuries since the hill’s slope is too gentle to build up much speed.\r\n\r\nBilly suffered a traumatic broken tooth and Susie suffered a contusion to the head.  Both are easy injuries for us to code. We know both are in for an initial encounter.\r\n\r\nFor Billy’s traumatic broken tooth, we would code:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S02.5XXA, fracture of tooth (traumatic), initial encounter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe don’t need to know which tooth, which is a good thing since Dr. Clause is not a dentist.\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM offers separate codes for no-traumatic cracked teeth and damage to dental fillings, so make sure you’re in the correct set of codes.\r\n\r\nFor Susie’s head contusion, we need to know the encounter and the specific location of her bump. Dr. Clause documents an initial visit for a contusion to the left temporal area.\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM does not contain a specific code for left temporal contusion so we need to use a Not Elsewhere Specified code:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S00.83XA, contusion of other part of head, initial encounter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nRemember this is not the same as a not otherwise specified code. For Susie’s injury, we know the site, we just don’t have a code for it (yet).\r\n\r\nFor both Billy and Susie, we would also report these activity codes to explain how they were injuried:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Y93.23, activity, snow (alpine) (downhill) skiing, snow boarding, sledding, tobogganing and snowtubing</li>\r\n	<li>Y92.830, public park as the place of occurrence of the external cause</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBilly and Susie, undaunted by their mishap, as ready to head back to Heartbreak Hill and try again.

As of today, 636 days remain until we start using ICD-10. By now, your organization should have created a steering committee for ICD-10 implementation.\r\n\r\nThat committee should have:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Completed its assessments of coder knowledge, clinical documentation, forms, policies, and IT systems.</li>\r\n	<li>Determined ICD-10 requirements and expectations for and from all affected departments (which is just about everyone).</li>\r\n	<li>Created a budget, so the organization knows how much to commit to the implementation.</li>\r\n	<li>Developed an implementation timeline, so you have measurable deadlines for the various projects that will encompass your organizations readiness. For example, “By March 30, 2012, all coders will have completed anatomy and physiology refresher training.”</li>\r\n	<li>Identify resources needed for a successful transition.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou also need to talk to your outside vendors and make sure they are on track for October 1, 2014.\r\n\r\nIf your organization hasn’t completed these steps, you are in danger of not being ready on October 1, 2014.\r\n\r\nIt’s still too early to start learning the actual ICD-10 codes, but you should be refreshing your knowledge of anatomy and physiology and medical terminology. You should also start becoming familiar with the structure of ICD-10. And if you are an inpatient coder, start learning the root operations definitions for ICD-10-PCS. They can be confusing.\r\n\r\nOutside of HIM, physicians should be reviewing documentation requirements and specificity for ICD-10. Clinical documentation improvement specialists should be evaluating current documentation against ICD-10 requirements and planning physician education to get them ready to document in ICD-10.\r\n\r\nICD-10 implementation is not just an HIM problem. It will affect everyone and you need to make sure staff members know what’s coming and how it will change the way they do their jobs. The ICD-10 steering committee’s work doesn’t end with creating a plan. The committee needs to make sure your organization sticks to the plan.\r\n\r\nDon’t panic if you get off track, stop and reassess. Figure out how you feel behind and what you need to do to catch up.\r\n\r\nIf you’re ahead of schedule, great, keep going. Being early will allow more time to practice with the new codes and test your systems. It will also give you time to find if  you missed anything during your initial planning. Chances are you will miss something, even if you have a solid plan in place. No plan is ever foolproof, but without a plan, you’ll never reach your implementation goals.',

We would report both:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>0DBM0ZZ, Excision of the descending colon</li>\r\n	<li>0DNE0ZZ for Release of the large intestines</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nReport enterolysis of intestinal adhesions with the root operation ‘Release’ for freeing a body part.\r\n\r\nCurrently, payers consider enterolysis of adhesions to be a part of the procedure unless the physician documents that the adhesions unusually complicated the procedure in some way. However, based on the ICD-10-PCS guidelines, it appears as if we would be able to report them separately.\r\n\r\nConfused yet? A lot of the rules for reporting multiple procedures will be new in ICD-10-PCS and some of them will be at odds not only with how we do things now, but how we’ll report procedures in the outpatient world.\r\n\r\nDon’t panic. The cooperating parties still have time to clear up the confusion, but we need to tell them what we don’t understand. AHA’s Coding Clinic is now accepting and answering ICD-10 questions, so if you are unsure about something, ask. Hopefully, we’ll get answers.',

And it’s dangerous, especially when your father is out to kill you and your friend gets encased in carbonite.\r\n\r\nIntrepid coders that we are, we will brave the frozen wasteland of Hoth and the swamps of Dagobah to code Luke Skywalker’s medical record.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/LightSabre.gif\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-3240\" title=\"LightSabre\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/LightSabre.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" /></a>Luke’s encounter with the hostile natives of Hoth didn’t end well. A wampa whacks him on the back of the head, knocking him unconscious.\r\n\r\nHe likely suffered a concussion with loss of consciousness, but how long was he out?  ICD-10-CM includes the following codes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S06.0X1, concussion with loss of consciousness of 30 minutes or less</li>\r\n	<li>S06.0X2, concussion with loss of consciousness of 31 minutes to 59 minutes</li>\r\n	<li>S06.0X3, concussion with loss of consciousness of 1 hour to 5 hours 59 minutes</li>\r\n	<li>S06.0X4, concussion with loss of consciousness of 6 hours to 24 hours</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe know he was out for less than 24 hours (Han Solo comes to rescue him before nightfall). However, if we are absolutely, positively unable to obtain a time, we can use an unspecified code:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S06.0X9, concussion with loss of consciousness of unspecified duration</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAll of the concussion codes require a seventh character to denote the encounter type, so be sure to add A (initial), D (subsequent), or S (sequela).\r\n\r\nLuke also suffered a head injury, but what kind? It could simply be a contusion to the back of the head, which gives us:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S00.83, contusion of other part of head</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThis code is also good for a bruise or hematoma. We do need to add a placeholder (X) and a seventh character. Also note that is a <em>Not Elsewhere Classified</em> code—meaning we know where the injury occurred, but we don’t have a code for it. Very different from unspecified.\r\n\r\nMaybe his injury is more substantial, such as a skull fracture. In that case, we need to know:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Which bone is broken</li>\r\n	<li>Whether the fracture is open or closed</li>\r\n	<li>Encounter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe don’t need to know whether the fracture is displaced or identify the laterality for skull fractures. We do need to know whether our patient suffered any intracranial injuries because we will have to code those as well from category S06.-.\r\n\r\nSince he was outside (or in an ice cave) for an extended period of time, Luke may suffer from frostbite or hypothermia.\r\n\r\nFor frostbite, we need to know the affect area (of course) and the encounter (naturally), as well as whether the frostbite is superficial (T33.-) or involves tissue necrosis (T34.-).\r\n\r\nWe would report a code for each specific area involved and in some cases, may report a superficial frostbite code for one body part and frostbite with tissue necrosis for another. It all depends on what the doctor documents.\r\n\r\nHypothermia is a little easier to code. ICD-10-CM only offers one code: T68 (hypothermia). We will need three placeholders when we use this code so our seventh character for the encounter ends up in the seventh position.\r\n\r\nHowever, we do need to use an additional code to identify source of exposure:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Exposure to excessive cold of man-made origin (W93)</li>\r\n	<li>Exposure to excessive cold of natural origin (X31)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIt’s also worth noting that Luke experiences some hallucinations or visions after the wampa assault. He thinks he sees and hears (the dead) Obi-Wan Kenobi.\r\n\r\nSo what caused the hallucinations? We need to know that to know whether to code them separately.  We don’t code signs and symptoms that are associated routinely with a disease process.\r\n\r\nFor example, Luke could be schizophrenic and that could account for his hallucinations. In that case we would code the schizophrenia and not the hallucinations.\r\n\r\nIf the hallucinations are not an integral part of another disease, we would choose the appropriate code(s) from:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>R44.0, auditory hallucinations</li>\r\n	<li>R44.1 visual hallucinations</li>\r\n	<li>R44.2, other hallucinations</li>\r\n	<li>R44.3, hallucinations, unspecified</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe R44.- series of codes includes both an Excludes1 note (not coded here) and an Excludes2 note (not included here), so be sure to review those before assigning a code for hallucinations.\r\n\r\nWell, that gets us through Luke’s adventures on Hoth. I think we’ll leave the swamps for another day. Until then, may the coding forces be with you!',

In addition, he complained of right shoulder pain.\r\n\r\nDr. Frosty exams Dave and learns that Dave normally doesn’t shovel, he hires a local teenager to do. Unfortunately for Dave, the kid is skiing in Vermont.\r\n\r\nAfter completing the exam, Dr. Frosty diagnoses Dave with a lower back strain and a pulled muscle in Dave’s right shoulder.\r\n\r\nThe low back strain is easy to code (we only have one code choice), but we do need a seventh character for the encounter. Dr. Frosty documented an initial visit, so the final code would be:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S39.012A, strain of muscle, fascia and tendon of lower back, initial encounter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nOn to the shoulder injury. Dr. Frosty documented “pulled muscle”. ICD-10-CM doesn’t include the term “pulled”. Fortunately, we know that a pulled muscle is a muscle sprain. Unfortunately, Dr. Frosty didn’t provide enough detail for us to code Dave’s sprain.\r\n\r\nWe need to know which muscle Dave injured so we need to query Dr. Frosty. Doc F replies that the injury is to Dave’s right rotator cuff, which give us:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S43.421A, sprain of right rotator cuff capsule, initial encounter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe can also add codes for Dave’s activities when injured:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Y93.H1, activity, digging, shoveling and raking (includes snow shoveling)</li>\r\n	<li>Y92.014, private driveway to single-family (private) house as the place of occurrence of the external cause</li>\r\n	<li>Y99.8, other external cause status (includes activity not elsewhere classified)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nOur next patient, Joe, thought he was smarter than Dave. Instead of relying on the local high school population to clear the snow, Joe bought a snow blower. That was a great plan until the blades got stuck. Joe turned off the snow blower, then reached in to clear out the snow. When he did, the blades moved and lacerated his hand.\r\n\r\nLuckily, Joe didn’t lose any fingers (or his whole hand for that matter). But he did get an earful of scolding from his wife as she drove him to the clinic.\r\n\r\nDr. Frosty examined Joe’s hand and documented an initial visit for lacerations of Joe’s right palm, index and middle fingers, not foreign bodies in the wounds.\r\n\r\nThe only other piece of information we need is whether Joe suffered damage to the nails of his index and middle fingers. Dr. Frosty confirms no injuries to the nails, so we would code:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S61.411A, laceration without foreign body of right hand, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S61.210A, laceration without foreign body of right index finger without damage to nail, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S61.212A, laceration without foreign body of right middle finger without damage to nail, initial encounter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nOur final patient, Helen, a 72-year-old, slipped and fell while walking down her snow-covered stairs. After examining her, Dr. Frosty documented an initial visit for:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Contusions to the buttocks</li>\r\n	<li>Contusions to the low back</li>\r\n	<li>Bruised left-side ribs</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nFortunately for Helen, nothing is broken. So we would code:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S30.0XXA, contusion of lower back and pelvis, initial encounter (this code includes contusion to the buttocks)</li>\r\n	<li>S20.222A, contusion of left back wall of thorax, initial encounter (this code covers Helen’s bruised ribs)</li>\r\n	<li>W00.1, fall from stairs and steps due to ice and snow</li>\r\n	<li>Y92.018, other place in single-family (private) house as the place of occurrence of the external cause</li>\r\n	<li>Y99.8, other external cause status</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThat’s all for today’s victims, I mean patients.

For the next three weeks I will focus on physician queries for 2013.  But first of all, review these best practices for physician queries.\r\n\r\nQueries should be:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Clearly and concisely written, contain precise language, present the facts and why clarification is needed, present the scenario</li>\r\n	<li>Individualized to each patient and contain clinical evidence specific to the case</li>\r\n	<li>Non-leading</li>\r\n	<li>Used to clarify the intent of the physician</li>\r\n	<li>Include the option that no additional documentation or clarification can be provided</li>\r\n	<li>Addressed to a specific provider and close with the query author’s name and phone number</li>\r\n	<li>Maintained in the medical record and be used as supporting documentation for coding</li>\r\n	<li>Sent using only approved templates</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nOn the other hand, queries should not:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Result in a yes/no answer</li>\r\n	<li>Be used as  a substitute for appropriate physician documentation in the record</li>\r\n	<li>Indicate to the provider an increase/decrease  in payment</li>\r\n	<li>Introduce information not otherwise contained in the medical record</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nFacilities should have a clear written policy or procedure to address the entire query process. The policy should:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Explain when it is appropriate to query a physician</li>\r\n	<li>How the query should be conducted</li>\r\n	<li>Address where and how long the query will be kept</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nMake sure staff members are trained so they are familiar with acceptable query procedure.\r\n\r\nAudit completed queries. Queries should be properly completed and appropriately dated and authenticated or they are noncompliant.\r\n\r\nOrganizations must also develop processes to:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Notify the provider when a query is placed (email, note, fax)</li>\r\n	<li>Following up on open queries</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nNext week I will blog about the ICD-10 documentation opportunities that we can begin implementing in 2013.',

Increased understanding of the documentation needs for ICD-10-CM includes the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus.\r\n\r\nDiabetes mellitus is a disorder of the endocrine portion of the pancreas. It is actually a group of metabolic disorders characterized by high blood sugar caused by a lack of insulin secretion by the pancreas. Blood sugars are normally tightly controlled by the secretion of insulin that keeps the blood glucose with a normal range. Insufficient insulin is the primary cause of Type I diabetes.\r\n\r\nType II diabetes is caused by insulin resistance. Even though an adequate amount of insulin is produced the body is unable to effectively use it.\r\n\r\nOther causes of diabetes include an underlying condition, such as:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Cushing’s syndrome</li>\r\n	<li>Malignant neoplasms</li>\r\n	<li>Pancreatitis</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nPeople may also suffer from drug or chemical induced diabetes. Gestational diabetes is a complication of pregnancy.\r\n\r\nUntreated diabetes leads to adverse effects on other body systems including eyes, kidneys, circulatory system, and nervous system.\r\n\r\n<strong>Compare the diabetes codes in ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM</strong> :\r\n\r\n<strong>In ICD-9-CM</strong>, diabetes mellitus appears in code categories 249-250. ICD-9-CM classifies diabetes as:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Type I</li>\r\n	<li>Type 2</li>\r\n	<li>Secondary</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSecondary diabetes is due to an underlying condition. Type 2 diabetes is not synonymous with secondary diabetes.\r\n\r\nThe fourth digit indicates the presence of manifestations or complications.\r\n\r\nThe fifth digit indicates the type of diabetes mellitus or unspecified diabetes and also whether it is uncontrolled or not stated as uncontrolled.\r\n\r\n<strong>In ICD-10-CM</strong>, diabetes mellitus appears in code categories E08-E13. Classified as follows:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>E08, diabetes mellitus due to an underlying condition. Note this category of codes is prefaced by an instructional note stating to code first the underlying condition.</li>\r\n	<li>E09, drug or chemically induced diabetes mellitus. This category includes diabetes mellitus due to various types of drugs and chemicals. An instructional note states that the code to identify the drug or chemical should be assigned first.</li>\r\n	<li>E10, Type I diabetes mellitus.</li>\r\n	<li>E11, Type 2 or diabetes not otherwise specified. E11 is the default when the type of diabetes is not specified in the documentation.</li>\r\n	<li>E13, other specified diabetes mellitus. This category of codes denotes diabetes mellitus that occurs due to some other specified reason that is not an underlying condition or due to a drug or chemical.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWhere is E12? Most likely the absence of E12 is intentional just in case a brand new category is created in the future. This is an example of ICD-10-CM’s ability to expand.',

So in honor of Groundhog Day (and <em>Groundhog Day</em>), let’s look at Phil’s various injuries and see what we would need to know in order to code them.\r\n\r\nPhil’s first foray into death involves the kidnapping of Punxsutawney Phil, a high-speed police chase, and incineration of Phil and Phil.\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM does not include a code for complete incineration, so we’ll have to report burn codes. ICD-10-CM distinguishes between burns (which are caused by a heat source such as fire) and corrosion (which is caused by chemicals).\r\n\r\nCurrent burns (T20-T25) are classified by depth, extent, and by agent (X code). Burns are classified by depth as:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>First degree (erythema)</li>\r\n	<li>Second degree (blistering</li>\r\n	<li>Third degree (full-thickness involvement)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBurns of the eye and internal organs (T26-T28) are classified by site, but not by degree.\r\n\r\nThe burn of the highest degree is coded first. So you would report T21.33 (burn of third degree of upper back) before T22.231 (burn of second degree of right upper arm).\r\n\r\nBurn codes require a seventh character to denote the encounter type, so you may need to add one or two X placeholders.\r\n\r\nWhen coding burns, assign separate codes for each burn site. Category T30 (burn and corrosion, body region unspecified) is extremely vague and should rarely be used. So if the physician doesn’t document the site with enough specificity, send a query. Remember, too, that burn codes include laterality.\r\n\r\nWe’ll also need to add a code from category T31 (burns classified according to extent of body surface involved). Codes in category T31 are based on the rule of nines to estimate body surface involved:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Head and neck, 9%</li>\r\n	<li>Each arm, 9%</li>\r\n	<li>Each leg, 18%</li>\r\n	<li>Anterior trunk, 18%</li>\r\n	<li>Posterior trunk, 18%</li>\r\n	<li>Genitalia, 1%</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWhen Phil wakes up again on Groundhog Day (again), none the worse for wear, he looks for other ways to end his bad day. None are successful.\r\n\r\nPhil tries:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Electrocuting himself—nice and easy because we have only one code: T75.4</li>\r\n	<li>Getting hit by a truck—somewhat more problematic because we need to know what injuries he sustained. Concussion? Lacerations? Internal injuries? Make sure it’s documented with the appropriate level of specificity. If not send a query.</li>\r\n	<li>Jumping from a tall building—broken bones, anyone? We’ll need to know site, laterality, open or closed, encounter, displaced or non-displaced.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSome other codes to keep in mind are the external causes codes (currently known as E codes). Possible external cause codes for Phil include, but are not limited to:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>X83.1, intentional self-harm by electrocution</li>\r\n	<li>V03.10, pedestrian on foot injured in collision with car, pick-up truck or van in traffic accident</li>\r\n	<li>X80, intentional self-harm by jumping from a high place</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nNote that these codes also require a seventh character for the encounter and all will need at least one placeholder.\r\n\r\nAnd don’t forget to check if Punxsutawney Phil caused any injuries to Weatherman<strong> </strong>Phil. ICD-10-CM includes codes for:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>W53.81, bitten by other rodent</li>\r\n	<li>W53.89, other contact with other rodent</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n(No people or groundhogs were injured in the writing of this blog.)',

Note that the Y93.2 series excludes injuries related to shoveling ice and snow. They have their own external causes code—Y93.H1.\r\n\r\nWe’ll also report X37.2 (blizzard [snow][ice]).  Don’t forget the seventh character to denote the encounter.\r\n\r\nPerhaps your patient is Lindsey Vonn, the Olympic skier who recently suffered torn knee ligaments in a horrible crash during a race. If we code the activity of skiing, we need to know what type of skiing:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Y93.23, activity, snow (alpine) (downhill) skiing, snow boarding, sledding, tobogganing, and snowtubing</li>\r\n	<li>Y93.24, activity, cross country skiing</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIn Lindsey’s case, it’s downhill skiing, so we would code Y93.23 in addition to her injury codes.\r\n\r\nWhat other trouble can we get into in the snow? We could fall because of the snow and ice (it’s not fun, I don’t recommend it). In that case, we would report a code from the W00.- series (fall due to ice and snow):\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>W00.0, fall on same level due to ice and snow</li>\r\n	<li>W00.1, fall from stairs and steps due to ice and snow</li>\r\n	<li>W00.2, other fall from one level to another due to ice and snow</li>\r\n	<li>W00.9, unspecified fall due to ice and snow</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese codes require a seventh character to denote the encounter, so we’ll need to add two X placeholders so our seventh character ends up in the seventh place.\r\n\r\nW00.0 also includes collusions with another person, so when you go sliding across the icy sidewalk straight into an innocent bystander, you get W00.0XXA (for the initial encounter).\r\n\r\nIf a patient comes in suffering from hypothermia (T68-), we need use additional code to identify source of exposure:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Exposure to excessive cold of man-made origin (W93)</li>\r\n	<li>Exposure to excessive cold of natural origin (X31)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nW93 requires a seventh character to denote the encounter type and includes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Excessive cold as the cause of chilblains NOS</li>\r\n	<li>Excessive cold as the cause of immersion foot or hand</li>\r\n	<li>Exposure to cold NOS</li>\r\n	<li>Exposure to weather conditions</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nW93 specifically excludes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>cold of man-made origin (W93.-)</li>\r\n	<li>contact with or inhalation of:</li>\r\n	<li>dry ice (W93.-)</li>\r\n	<li>liquefied gas (W93.-)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAll of these winter codes are making me cold.

The arrow itself would leave a puncture wound (probably), so we need to know where the arrow struck.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Cupid.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-3300\" title=\"Cupid\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Cupid-300x234.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"234\" /></a>Since it’s Valentine’s Day, we’ll credit Cupid with excellent aim and we’ll say he shot me through the heart. ICD-10-CM includes two possible codes for a puncture wound to the heart:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S26.09, other injury of heart with hemopericardium</li>\r\n	<li>S26.19, other injury of heart without hemopericardium</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBoth codes require a seventh character to denote the encounter and since they are only five characters long, we’ll need to add an X placeholder.\r\n\r\nWe can also add an external cause code for being shot with an arrow:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>X99.8, assault by other sharp object (note that we need two placeholders and a seventh character for encounter with this code)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAll three of our codes seem very unspecific, but keep in mind, we’re reporting “other” injuries and weapons. We know what the specific injury is and what caused it, we just don’t have a code specific enough.\r\n\r\nIn the aftermath of Cupid’s assault, my heart is beating fast at the sight of my true love. Oh, wait, maybe I’m actually experiencing palpitations—R00.2 (palpitations).\r\n\r\nI’m so excited (and my heart is beating so fast), I swoon. (That’s fainting in case you’re not a fan of romance novels). And fainting is also known as syncope.\r\n\r\nThat gives us ICD-10-CM code R55 (syncope and collapse). Before you report R55, make sure you review the extensive list of excluded codes and conditions.\r\n\r\nFortunately, my true love is fast on his feet and saves me from a nasty concussion from hitting the floor. (It’s about time he’s useful).\r\n\r\nAnd he brought me flowers, how sweet. Achoo! Or not. It seems I’ve suffering from an allergic reaction to the flowers. Achoo!\r\n\r\nMy pollen allergy (J30.1, allergic rhinitis due to pollen) is in full force, but I’ll take the flowers anyway. Oh look, roses! With thorns. Great, now I have puncture wounds to my hands.\r\n\r\nIn order to code those wounds, we need to know:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Which hand—left or right? Maybe it’s both. If so we’ll need to code for each separately.</li>\r\n	<li>Where specifically are the punctures--palm or fingers?</li>\r\n	<li>If the fingers are involved, which ones?</li>\r\n	<li>Is the nail involved?</li>\r\n	<li>Did part of the thorn remain?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nReally, can this get any worse?

Site represents either the bone or joint or muscle involved. For some conditions where more than one bone, joint or muscle is usually involved such as osteoarthritis there is a multiple site code. When no multiple site code is available coders should use codes to indicate the different sites involved.\r\n\r\n<strong>Bone vs. joint</strong>: For certain conditions, the bone may be affected at the upper or lower end. Though the portion of the bone affected may be at the joint, the site designation will be the bone, not the joint.\r\n\r\n<strong>Acute traumatic vs. chronic or recurrent conditions</strong>: The guidelines define these terms and provide coding instructions. If the musculoskeletal condition is from a previous injury or trauma or is recurrent, report a code from Chapter 13. Code any current acute injury with the appropriate injury code from chapter 19.  If you cannot determine whether the injury is acute or traumatic from the documentation in the record, query the physician.\r\n\r\n<strong>Coding pathological fractures</strong>: Pathologic fractures will require a seventh digit extension to identify episode of care. Use seventh character A as long as the patient is receiving active treatment. Active treatment is defined as:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Surgical treatment</li>\r\n	<li>ED encounter</li>\r\n	<li>Evaluation and treatment by a new physician</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nReport seventh character D for encounters after the patient has completed active treatment.  The other seventh characters listed under each subcategory in the Tabular List are to be used for subsequent encounters for treatment of problems associated with healing such as malunion, nonunion, and sequelae.\r\n\r\n<strong>Osteoporosis</strong>: The official coding guidelines instruct coders to report codes from category M81- for osteoporosis without pathological fracture. Report these codes for patients with osteoporosis who do not currently have a pathologic fracture due to osteoporosis even if they have had one in the past.\r\n\r\nFor history of osteoporosis fractures use code Z87.31 (personal history of osteoporosis fracture). This should follow the code from M81-.\r\n\r\nFor patients with osteoporosis with current pathological fracture at the time of the encounter, use codes from M80-. The codes under M80 identify the site of the fracture. Use a code from M8- for any patient with known osteoporosis who suffers a fracture, even if the patient had a minor fall or trauma, if that fall or trauma would not usually break a normal healthy bone.\r\n\r\nCodes for gout have been moved from Chapter 3 (endocrine, nutritional, and metabolic diseases) to Chapter12.\r\n\r\n<strong>Key Documentation elements for fractures</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Fracture codes require documentation of the type of fracture as displaced or non-displaced</li>\r\n	<li>More specific information is required on the fracture type. For example, codes for fracture of the surgical neck of the humerus are specific as to whether the fracture is a two-, three-, or four-part fracture.</li>\r\n	<li>Seventh characters are required to identify the episode of care and whether the fracture is open or closed.</li>\r\n	<li>Seventh characters also further classify open fractures using the Gustilo-Anderson open fracture classification system, which identifies fractures are Type I, II, IIIA, IIIB and IIIC.</li>\r\n</ul>',

ICD-10-CM includes two codes (but doesn’t include the abbreviation GERD):\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>K21.0, gastro-esophageal reflux disease with esophagitis</li>\r\n	<li>K21.9, gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe only difference is in ICD-10-CM, we need to know whether the patient has esophagitis, any inflammation, irritation, or swelling of the esophagus. Maybe physicians document that now, maybe they don’t.\r\n\r\nIf they don’t after the transition to ICD-10-CM, never fear. You don’t have to query (although it might not be a bad idea). You can default to K21.9, which includes esophageal reflux NOS.\r\n\r\nMaybe you’ve worried yourself into a digestive ulcer. In both coding systems, we need to know the location and both break codes down into these four areas:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Gastric</li>\r\n	<li>Duodenal</li>\r\n	<li>Peptic</li>\r\n	<li>Gastrojejunal</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBoth ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM include specific codes for\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Acute or chronic</li>\r\n	<li>With hemorrhage</li>\r\n	<li>With perforation</li>\r\n	<li>With hemorrhage and perforation</li>\r\n	<li>Without mention of hemorrhage or perforation</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThis is all very familiar. ICD-9-CM actually seems to require one piece of information ICD-10-CM does not: a character to identify without mention of obstruction or with obstruction.\r\n\r\nThis is easy. We need the same information, we’re coding to the same sites.\r\n\r\nThings get a little more complicated when we look at Cronh’s disease. ICD-9-CM offers four codes in the 555 series (regional enteritis):\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>555.0, small intestine</li>\r\n	<li>555.1, large intestine</li>\r\n	<li>555.2, small intestine with large intestine</li>\r\n	<li>555.9, unspecified site</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nICD-10-CM includes these four main categories:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>K50.0, Crohn\'s disease of small intestine</li>\r\n	<li>K50.1, Crohn\'s disease of large intestine</li>\r\n	<li>K50.8, Crohn\'s disease of both small and large intestine</li>\r\n	<li>K50.9, Crohn\'s disease, unspecified</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nEach of those categories contains two main subcategories for without complications and with complications.\r\n\r\nThe subcategories for with complication include six additional codes to specify the complication. For example, for Crohn’s disease of the large intestine with complications, we would choose from:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>K50.111, Crohn\'s disease of large intestine with rectal bleeding</li>\r\n	<li>K50.112, Crohn\'s disease of large intestine with intestinal obstruction</li>\r\n	<li>K50.113, Crohn\'s disease of large intestine with fistula</li>\r\n	<li>K50.114, Crohn\'s disease of large intestine with abscess</li>\r\n	<li>K50.118, Crohn\'s disease of large intestine with other complication</li>\r\n	<li>K50.119, Crohn\'s disease of large intestine with unspecified complications</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe’re going to need a lot more information from the physicians before we can accurately code Crohn’s disease. If you code a large volume of cases for Crohn’s, start working with your physicians now to make sure they’re including the necessary additional information. Otherwise, you’re going to be sending them a lot of queries after October 1, 2014.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, someone pass me an antacid.',

What a fun (cough, cough) place to start.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/plague-germs.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-3343\" title=\"plague germs\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/plague-germs-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a>The very first disease listed in the <em>ICD-9-CM Manual</em> is cholera, an infection of the small intestine that causes a large amount of watery diarrhea.  That sounds perfectly unpleasant. It’s probably also not a disease you’ll code often unless you start coding for Doctors Without Borders. Cholera occurs in places with poor sanitation, crowding, war, and famine.\r\n\r\nCoding for cholera is exactly the same in ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM. The only difference is the actual code numbers. If you do get a patient with cholera, you have three choices:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Cholera due to Vibrio cholerae 01, biovar cholera</li>\r\n	<li>Cholera due to Vibrio cholerae 01, biovar eltor</li>\r\n	<li>Cholera, unspecified</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nUnfortunately the manuals include plenty of other unpleasant infectious diseases and not all are as easy to translate from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM.\r\n\r\nTake tuberculosis (TB) for example. In ICD-9-CM, we use a fifth character to denote how the TB was identified. For example, fifth digit 3 is added when the tubercle bacilli found (in sputum) by microscopy.\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM does not ask for that information.\r\n\r\nIn addition, while TB is divided by location or affected organ in both ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM, the categories are different and they include different subcategories. ICD-9-CM includes one code for TB of the eye—017.3—with six choices for the fifth digit. So you have a total of six possible codes.\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM also includes six codes, but they are very different codes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>A18.50, Tuberculosis of eye, unspecified</li>\r\n	<li>A18.51, Tuberculous episcleritis</li>\r\n	<li>A18.52, Tuberculous keratitis</li>\r\n	<li>A18.53, Tuberculous chorioretinitis</li>\r\n	<li>A18.54, Tuberculous iridocyclitis</li>\r\n	<li>A18.59, Other tuberculosis of eye</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nHistoplasmosis is an infection that occurs from breathing in the spores of the fungus Histoplasma capsulatum and is also known as caver’s disease and spelunker\'s lung. How often you see this disease in charts will depend on where you (or the organization you code for) are located.\r\n\r\nICD-9-CM includes three codes for histoplasmosis and seven possible fifth digits to identify associated manifestations.\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM includes seven codes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>B39.0, acute pulmonary histoplasmosis capsulati</li>\r\n	<li>B39.1, chronic pulmonary histoplasmosis capsulati</li>\r\n	<li>B39.2, pulmonary histoplasmosis capsulati, unspecified</li>\r\n	<li>B39.3, disseminated histoplasmosis capsulati</li>\r\n	<li>B39.4, histoplasmosis capsulati, unspecified</li>\r\n	<li>B39.5, histoplasmosis duboisii</li>\r\n	<li>B39.9, histoplasmosis, unspecified</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe ICD-10-CM codes don’t mention any associated manifestations. That’s because ICD-10-CM requires you to use an additional code for any associated manifestations. So instead of adding a fifth character, in ICD-10-CM you’ll add a whole code.\r\n\r\nWhile you’re reviewing the new codes for infectious and parasitic diseases, don’t forget to review the coding guidelines. Many, but not all, of the guidelines remain the same. The guidelines for Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus look very similar, just with different codes, but the guidelines for sepsis are different.',

For example, “away put your weapon, I mean you no harm.”\r\n\r\nCould Yoda be suffering from aphasia, a disturbance of the comprehension and formulation of language caused by dysfunction in specific brain regions? If so, how would we code it in ICD-10-CM?\r\n\r\nThe first thing we need to know is the cause of the aphasia. Is it a developmental disorder (F80.2, mixed receptive-expressive language disorder)?\r\n\r\nOr is it the result of a degenerative brain disorder?\r\n\r\nPerhaps it’s really a sequela of a non-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (I69.020) or some other brain injury.  Coders should report a code from category I69 to indicate conditions in I60-I67 as the cause of sequelae. The \'sequelae\' include conditions specified as such or as residuals which may occur at any time after the onset of the causal condition.\r\n\r\nIf the cause is not classified elsewhere, we would look to R47.01 (aphasia). Pay attention to the Excludes1 note:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>aphasia following cerebrovascular disease (I69. with final characters -20)</li>\r\n	<li>progressive isolated aphasia (G31.01)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYoda also walks with a limp. And really, considering he’s 800 years old, he’s in pretty good shape. But what causes him to limp? Perhaps, given his age, he suffers from osteoarthritis.\r\n\r\nYou’ll find the ICD-10-CM codes for osteoarthritis in categories M15-M19. The codes are divided by the location of the osteoarthritis. For example, category M16 covers osteoarthritis of the hip, which can be:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Bilateral</li>\r\n	<li>Unilateral</li>\r\n	<li>Unilateral resulting from hip dysplasia</li>\r\n	<li>Bilateral post-traumatic</li>\r\n	<li>Unilateral post-traumatic</li>\r\n	<li>Other bilateral secondary</li>\r\n	<li>Other unilateral secondary</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIf the osteoarthritis is only present unilaterally, you will need to specify the laterality when you chose your code.\r\n\r\nLuke, meanwhile, seems to weather his time in the swamp relatively well until Yoda sends him into a hollow tree and a dark underground labyrinth. That’s when Luke’s hallucinations return with a vengeance, making that schizophrenia diagnosis look better and better. Actually, to be fair, Luke’s been hallucinating a lot on Dagobah from the day he crash-landed.\r\n\r\nIn the tree, Luke thinks he sees Darth Vader and cuts off Vader’s helmet which cracks open after hitting the ground to reveal…Luke’s face. Freud would have a field day with that imagery.\r\n\r\nSuppose Luke really does suffer from schizophrenia. How do we code it in ICD-10-CM?\r\n\r\nFirst, we need to know what type of schizophrenia Luke has:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>F20.0, paranoid schizophrenia</li>\r\n	<li>F20.1, disorganized schizophrenia</li>\r\n	<li>F20.2, catatonic schizophrenia</li>\r\n	<li>F20.3, undifferentiated schizophrenia</li>\r\n	<li>F20.5, residual schizophrenia</li>\r\n	<li>F20.8, other schizophrenia</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nMaybe Luke is just delusional (F22, delusional disorders). Or it could be a schizoaffective disorder (F25).\r\n\r\nOr it could be delusions brought on by some swamp-borne illness.\r\n\r\nRegardless, I think it’s time for Luke to head off to the Cloud City and leave the swamp in his rearview mirror.',

Eddie raced back to catch a fly ball and jumped up. Unfortunately, he was too close to the fence and ripped his right ear open on the top of the fence.  He cut through the cartilage in his ear and now sports a spiffy row of stitches. Fence 1, Eddie 0.\r\n\r\nDr. Selig documented no foreign body in the laceration and also noted this was Eddie’s first visit. That gives us ICD-10-CM code S01.311A, laceration without foreign body of right ear, initial visit.\r\n\r\nWe can also add some codes for external causes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>W18.01xA, striking against sports equipment with subsequent fall, initial encounter (if you consider the fence a piece of baseball equipment)</li>\r\n	<li>Y92.320, baseball field as the place of occurrence of the external cause</li>\r\n	<li>Y93.64, activity, baseball</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nEddie’s teammate Ken also suffered a setback in the first game of the season. Ken failed to move out of the path of an oncoming fastball and earned a free base—and a massive bruise to his hip. Fortunately, the pitch wasn’t that fast, so Ken didn’t suffer any breaks, but he’s going to be sore for a while.\r\n\r\nWhen we review Dr. Selig’s note, we find that he did not document laterality or encounter. That means we need to query.\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM does contain a code for contusion to unspecified hip, but in order for any contusion code to be valid, we need a seventh character to denote the encounter. Since we’re asking for one piece of information, we may as well ask for both. That way the record will be more complete and we don’t need to worry about a possible denial for an unspecified code.\r\n\r\nDr. Selig responds (three days later) with a notation of left hip, initial encounter, so we would report:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S70.02xA, contusion of left hip</li>\r\n	<li>W21.03xA, struck by baseball</li>\r\n	<li>Y92.320, baseball field as the place of occurrence of the external cause</li>\r\n	<li>Y93.64, activity, baseball</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nNote that we need placeholders for codes for the contusion and the struck by baseball. Without the X placeholder, the seventh character ends up in the sixth position, making the code invalid.\r\n\r\nEddie and Ken will both be back on the field tomorrow, but their teammate Keith is headed for the injured reserve. Keith slid into second and dislocated his right ankle when he hit the bag awkwardly. To add insult to injury, he was out. He had larceny in his heart, but lead in his feet. And now a cast to go with it.\r\n\r\nWhat do we need in Dr. Selig’s documentation to code Keith’s dislocated ankle?\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Laterality (right)</li>\r\n	<li>Encounter (initial)</li>\r\n	<li>Dislocation or subluxation (dislocation)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThat gives us:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S93.04xA, dislocation of right ankle joint, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>Y92.320, baseball field as the place of occurrence of the external cause</li>\r\n	<li>Y93.64, activity, baseball</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe would not report W18.01xA because Keith didn’t fall.

Maybe the people who responded didn’t know about their organizations ICD-10 committee (which is a whole different problem). But still, if you don’t have an ICD-10 committee, you probably don’t have an ICD-10 transition plan.\r\n\r\nAccording to an Aloft survey of 260 healthcare providers, only 25% of respondents have completed at least a quarter of their ICD-10 transition plan as of February.\r\n\r\nHRAA released the results of its survey, which found that only 40% of organizations have not yet started training coders on ICD-10-CM. Half of the respondents reported that they have not started training on ICD-10-PCS.\r\n\r\nThe AAPC implementation tracker includes nine steps and at this point, AAPC recommends organizations should be completing steps 5 (planning) and 6 (training).\r\n\r\nAHIMA’s timeline includes only four steps, with the first through third quarters of 2013 devoted to step 2 (implementation preparation). That includes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Continuing coder training</li>\r\n	<li>Training non-coding staff about  ICD-10</li>\r\n	<li>Assessing  documentation</li>\r\n	<li>Assessing the potential reimbursement effect of transition</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSo where are you in the transition process? Do you have a committee? Are you training? Do you even know what your training needs are?\r\n\r\nDon’t count on another delay. In February, Acting CMS Administrator Marilyn Tavenner sent the AMA a letter stating the ICD-10 transition date would not change. I know, we’ve heard that before, but at this point, we really can’t delay ICD-10 any longer.\r\n\r\nThis is not a transition that you can accomplish in a few months.

		'body' : '<em>Editor’s note: For purposes of today’s example, we are ignoring medical necessity. We’re going to say Sidney is an inpatient. In the real world, he would need to meet the criteria for an inpatient admission. This example is for educational purposes. </em>\r\n\r\nSidney is admitted to Stitch ‘Em Up Hospital after be<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hockey-puck.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright  wp-image-3386\" title=\"hockey puck\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hockey-puck-300x234.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"253\" height=\"197\" /></a>ing hit in the mouth with a hockey puck during a hockey game. The injury occurred at the rink. In addition to a broken jaw, Sidney also lost several teeth.\r\n\r\nDr. Coffey performed surgery to repair Sidney’s broken teeth two days ago and is now preparing to insert a plate and screws to stabilize Sidney’s broken jaw.\r\n\r\nIf we look at the ICD-10-CM coding for Sidney’s injuries, his broken teeth look pretty easy to code. We only have one code choice: S02.5 (fracture of tooth [traumatic]).\r\n\r\nHowever, we do need to add a seventh character to denote the encounter.  Since the code only has four characters, we need to add two placeholders so the encounter ends up in the seventh spot.\r\n\r\nBefore working on Sidney’s jaw, Dr. Francis examines Sidney’s teeth and documents routine healing. We would report S02.5XXA. We are using the seventh character A because Dr. Francis is a new physician. If Dr. Coffey had seen Sidney to evaluate the healing of the tooth fractures, we would use seventh character D.\r\n\r\nNow let’s turn our attention to Sidney’s jaw. The first thing we need to know is what specific part of the jaw is fractured. ICD-10-CM includes the following codes for fracture of the mandible:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S02.60, fracture of mandible, unspecified</li>\r\n	<li>S02.61, fracture of condylar process of mandible</li>\r\n	<li>S02.62, fracture of subcondylar process of mandible</li>\r\n	<li>S02.63, fracture of coronoid process of mandible</li>\r\n	<li>S02.64, fracture of ramus of mandible</li>\r\n	<li>S02.65, fracture of angle of mandible</li>\r\n	<li>S02.66, fracture of symphysis of mandible</li>\r\n	<li>S02.67, fracture of alveolus of mandible</li>\r\n	<li>S02.69, fracture of mandible of other specified site</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nNotice that these codes do not contain laterality. They do require a seventh character for the encounter, and because they are only five characters long, they also need one placeholder. That seventh character will also detail whether the fracture is open or closed.\r\n\r\nDr. Francis documents an initial encounter for treatment of a closed fracture of the alveolus following traumatic impact of a hockey puck.\r\n\r\nThat gives us code S02.67XA.\r\n\r\nWe can also include these codes for external causes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>W21.220A, struck by ice hockey puck, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>Y92.330, ice skating rink (indoor) (outdoor) as the place of occurrence of the external cause</li>\r\n	<li>Y93.22, activity, ice hockey</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nNow, let’s move on to the actual surgical procedure. Time to turn to ICD-10-PCS (again, in the real world we would probably use CPT codes for an outpatient procedure, but we’re pretending.)\r\n\r\nWe know our first character will be 0 for medical and surgical.\r\n\r\nNext, we need the body system. In Sidney’s case, it’s the mandible, which falls under head and facial bones (second character N).\r\n\r\nNow we need the root operation. What is the intent of the procedure? Dr. Francis is inserting a metal (non-biological) plate and screws into Sidney’s jaw to stabilize the fracture. We know the fracture is closed, but is it also displaced? That information will affect the root operation. Displaced fractures require manipulation to put the bone(s) back into place before inserting the plate and screws.\r\n\r\nDr. Coffey documented a displaced fracture during Sidney’s initial treatment and Dr. Francis confirms this information in his operative note.\r\n\r\nDr. Francis also documents performing an open reduction with internal fixation. He does document making the incision prior to repositioning the bone.\r\n\r\nThat gives us root operation reposition and a third character S. If the fracture had been non-displaced, we would use root operation insertion.\r\n\r\nWith this much of the code—0NS—we can get to the correct table in ICD-10-PCS and finish building our code.\r\n\r\nThe fourth character denotes the body part. For Sidney’s surgery, it’s the mandible. However, in order to select the correct ICD-10-PCS code, we need the laterality. The right and left sides of the mandible have separate body part characters. So even though we don’t need laterality for the ICD-10-CM code, we do need it in ICD-10-PCS.\r\n\r\nDr. Francis’ operative note states “right side of mandible” which makes our fourth character T.\r\n\r\nFor the fifth character, we need to know what approach Dr. Francis used:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Open (0)</li>\r\n	<li>Percutaneous (3)</li>\r\n	<li>Percutaneous endoscopic (4)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe know this is an open procedure, so our fifth character is 0. Dr. Francis documented an internal fixation device, making our sixth character 4. The seventh character will always be Z (no qualifier) because that’s our only option for this table.\r\n\r\nOur final code is 0NST04Z, reposition right mandible with internal fixation device, open approach.\r\n\r\nThat brings our case to a close and we’ll discharge Sidney with the advice to duck next time a puck comes flying at his face.',

Orthopedic and emergency medicine physicians will face lots of changes, while radiology and family practice physicians will see a small impact, according to Spain.\r\n\r\nThe net result: No one size fits all solution for ICD-10 implementation.\r\n\r\n“One size fits most means that most people are disappointed with what they get,” Spain said.\r\n\r\nMake sure your ICD-10 planning takes into account the specific needs of your organization.

The good news is that they do conform entirely to the body systems and body parts found in ICD-10-CM chapters.</li>\r\n	<li>The body system designations subdivide into smaller components.

For example, liver should be assigned only when the documentation in the medical record does not indicate the part of the liver and the coder cannot obtain the information from the physician.  This could potentially mean a physician query to assign the most specific body part designation.</li>\r\n	<li>When the documentation describes a portion of a body part and ICD-10-PCS does not have a specific designation for that part then the whole body part designation is used. For example, if a procedure is performed on the alveolar process of the mandible the character for mandible is assigned because the alveolar process is not specifically identified as a separate body part.</li>\r\n	<li>Body parts with the prefix “peri” (which means around or surrounding) may have a specific character for the body part. If not report the body part preceded by the prefix “peri” in the operative report with the character for that body part. Example: Pericardium is designated as a specific body part.

Let’s start with her carpal tunnel. If we look up syndrome, carpal tunnel in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index, it directs us to G56.0-. The dash tells us the code needs additional characters, so we absolutely must look in the Tabular Index.\r\n\r\nYou should never code from the Alphabetic Index alone, anyway. That’s one of the many things that won’t change after the transition to ICD-10-CM.\r\n\r\nG56.0 gives us three choices:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>G56.00, carpal tunnel syndrome, unspecified upper limb</li>\r\n	<li>G56.01, carpal tunnel syndrome, right upper limb</li>\r\n	<li>G56.02, carpal tunnel syndrome, left upper limb</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe need to review Dr. Morang’s documentation to determine the laterality so we can assign the most detailed code. ICD-10-CM does include an unspecified option, but we want to avoid reporting unspecified if at all possible. That means if the physician didn’t document laterality, query!\r\n\r\nMoving on to the osteoarthrosis, we find a note in the Alphabetic Index that tells us to see also Osteoarthritis.\r\n\r\nGeneralized osteoarthrosis of the hand doesn’t really give us much to go on to find the correct ICD-10-CM code. We need more information.\r\n\r\nDoes Penny suffer from bony bumps on the finger joint closest to the fingernail (Heberden\'s nodes), which would lead us to ICD-10-CM code M15.1 (Heberden\'s nodes [with arthropathy]).\r\n\r\nOr does she have bony bumps on the middle joint of the finger (Bouchard\'s nodes)? In that case, we would report M15.2 (Bouchard\'s nodes [with arthropathy]).\r\n\r\nDoes Dr. Morang mean Penny suffers from osteoarthritis of the hand joint or the bones in her hand in general?\r\n\r\nWe also need to know if the osteoarthrosis is primary, secondary, or post-traumatic.\r\n\r\nFor the pain in Penny’s forearm, we again need laterality. Our choices are:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>M79.631, pain in right forearm</li>\r\n	<li>M79.632, pain in left forearm</li>\r\n	<li>M79.639, pain in unspecified forearm</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe also need to know if the pain is a separate problem or if it is a symptom of one of Penny’s other diagnoses. If it’s a symptom, we don’t code it separately (regardless of what Dr. Morang says).\r\n\r\nFinally, we need to code the contracture of palmer fascia. You may be more familiar with the term Dupuytren\'s contracture. Both lead us to the same ICD-10-CM code—M72.0 (palmar fascial fibromatosis [Dupuytren]).\r\n\r\nInterestingly, M72.0 does not require laterality. We only have one code, which could be a problem if Penny develops the same condition in both hands.\r\n\r\nSo we’ll wish Penny well, but avoid shaking her hand.',

When I first started coding, my boot camp instructor Peggy Blue, MPH, CPC, CCS-P, said coders tell the patient’s story using codes. ICD-10-CM allows coders to tell better stories about patients and detail what happened to them and how.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Turkey.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-3431\" title=\"Turkey\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Turkey-300x274.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"274\" /></a>Some of the external causes codes are pretty funny and you’ll probably never report them. If you work in an urban setting, you’ll probably never report W61.4- (contact with turkey) unless someone is trying to kill his or her own Thanksgiving dinner.\r\n\r\nIf you don’t live near water, you likely won’t need V94.1 (bather struck by watercraft) or W56.2- (contact with orca). Well, you might need the orca, dolphin (W56.0-), and sea lion codes (W56.1-) if you work near Sea World. But let’s hope you don’t have cause to use them.\r\n\r\nThe ICD-10-CM external causes codes include codes for encounters with a variety of animals including, but not limited to:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Alligator</li>\r\n	<li>Crocodile</li>\r\n	<li>Nonvenomous reptiles</li>\r\n	<li>Parrot</li>\r\n	<li>Macaw</li>\r\n	<li>Chicken</li>\r\n	<li>Goose</li>\r\n	<li>Frogs</li>\r\n	<li>Toads</li>\r\n	<li>Squirrel</li>\r\n	<li>Cow</li>\r\n	<li>Dog</li>\r\n	<li>Cat</li>\r\n	<li>Mouse</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe only thing missing seems to be an attacking partridge in a pear tree. Oh wait, that’s contact with other birds (W61.9-).\r\n\r\nThose codes seem to get the most attention. In fact, Rep. Ted Poe, R-Texas, called out the turkey codes as a way to bolster his argument that the government should stop ICD-10 implementation. He’s even introduced a bill—<a href=\"http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr1701/text?utm_campaign=govtrack_email_update&amp;utm_source=govtrack/email_update&amp;utm_medium=email\" target=\"_blank\">H.R. 1701: Cutting Costly Codes Act of 2013</a>—to that effect. Take two minutes and read the bill. Trust me, you’ll only need two minutes. It’s not very long.\r\n\r\nPoe also mocked the codes for walking into a lamp post (W22.02-). I’ve made fun of that code too, mainly because I can’t image anyone actually admitting he or she walked into a lamp post. At least not sober.\r\n\r\nHere’s something he didn’t consider though. How often does an abuse victim claim to have walked into a door or fallen down the stairs? So if a physician or nurse sees a patient who is always walking into things, the clinician might suspect abuse. Or that the patient has a problem with vision. That can be valuable information when forming a diagnosis and also to potentially support a criminal charge against an abuser. Or a bully.\r\n\r\nWe know ICD-10 will change the way we code. We know it’s going to cost a lot of money and decrease productivity. But we also know (at least I hope we do) that ICD-10 will give us better data and a better clinical picture of the patient’s condition. That alone is a good reason to move forward with implementation.\r\n\r\nHere are four other good reasons:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>ICD-9 is out of space</li>\r\n	<li>We’ve already spent literally millions preparing for the change</li>\r\n	<li>We can’t talk to the rest of the world about healthcare, diseases, and mortality rates</li>\r\n	<li>We’re 15 years behind Canada</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nOn a more serious note, we all hope we never have to use any of the codes under Y36.5 (war operations involving nuclear weapons).\r\n\r\n&nbsp;',

The report will be submitted to the House of Delegates during its June meeting and until approved by the delegates, it does not represent the AMA’s official position.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Cadusius.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-3449\" alt=\"Cadusius\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Cadusius-300x300.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a>AMA members discussed potentially advocating for ICD-11 over ICD-10 during the AMA’s 2012 annual meeting. During that meeting, the AMA House of Delegates adopted Policy D-70.952 “Stop the Implementation of ICD-10.” The policy called for investigating the benefits of moving from ICD-9 to ICD-11.\r\n\r\nIt turns out that skipping ICD-10 may not be a good thing. The report to the board lists only three reasons to move directly to ICD-11:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>ICD-11 implementation would be costly and time-consuming regardless of whether the US implements ICD-10</li>\r\n	<li>Physicians would only have to go through one transition, not two</li>\r\n	<li>By waiting for ICD-11, healthcare organizations will have more time to adopt electronic medical records develop the electronic systems infrastructure for health information exchange</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe AMA report lists six reasons not to wait for ICD-11 including:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>ICD-9 is outdated and limited (thanks for finally noticing)</li>\r\n	<li>Healthcare will miss out on the improvements associated with ICD-10 coding, such as laterality, greater specificity, and more room to add codes</li>\r\n	<li>Healthcare providers and coders will have a more difficult time learning ICD-11 without learning ICD-10 first</li>\r\n	<li>Focusing solely on moving from ICD-9 to ICD-11 risks missing the opportunity to educate physicians and leaving them unprepared for the anticipated transition to ICD-10, which could result in significant cash flow disruptions</li>\r\n	<li>ICD-10 should reduce payers’ requests for additional information, which eases the burden on physicians</li>\r\n	<li>ICD-11 is still 20 years away from implementation (the World Health Organization is still working on the codes and ICD-11 won’t even be beta tested for another two or three years)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThat does not mean that the AMA now endorses ICD-10 implementation. It doesn’t.  The AMA touts its success in holding off ICD-10 implementation for more than a decade and for convincing HHS to push the date back from October 1, 2013, to October 1, 2014.\r\n\r\nThe AMA “harbors serious concerns and reservations” about the burden of ICD-10 implementation and based on current information, doesn’t not recommend moving from ICD-9 straight to ICD-11.\r\n\r\nI think it’s great that the AMA is finally acknowledging some of the benefits of ICD-10, but I wish the AMA would actually endorse the switch. Change is never easy, but we’ve put this off long enough.\r\n\r\nICD-10 itself is getting a little long in the tooth. The World Health Organization released the first version of ICD-10 in 1998. Twenty-five countries already use ICD-10, although most don’t use it for reimbursement purposes like the US will.\r\n\r\nThe benefits to implementing ICD-10 outweigh the disadvantages and frankly, we can’t keep using ICD-9.\r\n\r\nHealthcare organizations on both the provider and payer sides have already spent considerable time and money preparing for the transition. Better technology and better patient information are good things. I just wish the AMA would see it that way.',

The codes just look different.\r\n\r\nNow that we have our diagnoses in order, let’s consider the actual double mastectomy.\r\n\r\nAngelina is undergoing a surgical procedure, which gives us our first character: 0. Our second character is H, for body system skin and breast.\r\n\r\nThat brings us to our third character, the root operation. According to the ICD-10-PCS guidelines, coders must select the root operation that describes the intent of the procedure, regardless of what the physician calls it in the documentation. So we need to know what the surgeon is doing.\r\n\r\nIs the surgeon removing part of a body part (excision) or all of the body part (resection)?  For a partial mastectomy, we would use excision. For a radical mastectomy, which involves removing not only the breast but also the underlying chest muscle (including pectoralis major and pectoralis minor) and lymph nodes, we would use resection.\r\n\r\nFortunately, surgeons rarely perform a total mastectomy now. They more commonly perform a partial mastectomy or a modified radical mastectomy. In a modified radical mastectomy, the surgeon removes the breast (including the skin, breast tissue, areola, and nipple) and most of the lymph nodes under the arm.\r\n\r\nWe don’t have Angelina’s chart to see exactly what her surgeon documented, but because she underwent a nipple delay, which is designed to save the nipple and does not talk about lymph nodes being removed, we’ll call the procedure a partial mastectomy.\r\n\r\nThat gives us our third character: B (excision).\r\n\r\nGo to your ICD-10-PCS manual (or your online PDF) and find the table for OHB (medical and surgical, skin and breast, excision).\r\n\r\nWe have three choices for our fourth character:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>T, breast, right</li>\r\n	<li>U, breast, left</li>\r\n	<li>V, breast, bilateral</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIn Angelina’s case, it’s bilateral, so our fourth character is V.\r\n\r\nA mastectomy is an open procedure, which means our fifth character is 0. We only have one choice for a sixth character (Z), which makes things pretty easy. Choosing a seventh character for this surgery is also easy. Our two choices are diagnostic (X) and no qualifier (Z).\r\n\r\nWe know it’s not a diagnostic procedure, so our seventh character is Z.\r\n\r\nPut all of them together and we get: 0HBV0ZZ (excision of bilateral breast, open approach).',

In many cases, you are coding the same information, but instead of adding a fifth character or in some cases an additional code, everything you need is in one code.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/TIP.gif\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-3138\" alt=\"TIP\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/TIP.gif\" width=\"197\" height=\"197\" /></a>Let’s look at some examples from the congenital abnormalities codes, starting with spina bifida.\r\n\r\nIn ICD-9-CM, we have two main codes for spina bifida:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>741.0, spina bifida with hydrocephalus</li>\r\n	<li>741.1, spina bifida without hydrocephalus</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThose codes each require a fifth digit to specify the location:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>0, Unspecified region</li>\r\n	<li>1, Cervical region</li>\r\n	<li>2, Dorsal (thoracic) region</li>\r\n	<li>3, Lumbar region</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIn ICD-10-CM, the location is an integral part of the code:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Q05.0, cervical spina bifida with hydrocephalus</li>\r\n	<li>Q05.1, thoracic spina bifida with hydrocephalus</li>\r\n	<li>Q05.2, lumbar spina bifida with hydrocephalus</li>\r\n	<li>Q05.3, sacral spina bifida with hydrocephalus</li>\r\n	<li>Q05.4, unspecified spina bifida with hydrocephalus</li>\r\n	<li>Q05.5, cervical spina bifida without hydrocephalus</li>\r\n	<li>Q05.6, thoracic spina bifida without hydrocephalus</li>\r\n	<li>Q05.7, lumbar spina bifida without hydrocephalus</li>\r\n	<li>Q05.8, sacral spina bifida without hydrocephalus</li>\r\n	<li>Q05.9, spina bifida, unspecified</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou’re still coding the exact same information, it’s just set up differently.\r\n\r\nOne difference to note however is Arnold-Chiari syndrome, which is a malformation of the brain. In ICD-9-CM, it is including under spina bifida with hydrocephalus. In ICD-10-CM, it has its own code series: (Arnold-Chiari syndrome, type II, Q07.0-), which provides additional details about the condition.\r\n\r\nYou’ll find some differences in the information required to code cleft lip, cleft palate, or both. In ICD-9-CM, the codes for cleft lip, cleft palate, and cleft palate with cleft lip are divided into:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Unilateral complete</li>\r\n	<li>Unilateral incomplete</li>\r\n	<li>Bilateral complete</li>\r\n	<li>Bilateral incomplete</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe ICD-10-CM codes are more specific about where the anomaly is located. For example, for a cleft palate, you will choose from these codes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Q35.1, cleft hard palate</li>\r\n	<li>Q35.3, cleft soft palate</li>\r\n	<li>Q35.5, cleft hard palate with cleft soft palate</li>\r\n	<li>Q35.7, cleft uvula</li>\r\n	<li>Q35.9, cleft palate, unspecified</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nFor a cleft lip, you have these three choices:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Q36.0, cleft lip, bilateral</li>\r\n	<li>Q36.1, cleft lip, median</li>\r\n	<li>Q36.9, cleft lip, unilateral</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAs you can probably guess, the codes for cleft palate with cleft lip provide a wealth of detail about the patient’s particular problem. Those codes include:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Q37.0, cleft hard palate with bilateral cleft lip</li>\r\n	<li>Q37.1, cleft hard palate with unilateral cleft lip</li>\r\n	<li>Q37.2, cleft soft palate with bilateral cleft lip</li>\r\n	<li>Q37.3, cleft soft palate with unilateral cleft lip</li>\r\n	<li>Q37.4, cleft hard and soft palate with bilateral cleft lip</li>\r\n	<li>Q37.5, cleft hard and soft palate with unilateral cleft lip</li>\r\n	<li>Q37.8, unspecified cleft palate with bilateral cleft lip</li>\r\n	<li>Q37.9, unspecified cleft palate with unilateral cleft lip</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nOur last congenital malformation for the day is syndactyly. In ICD-9-CM, the codes include webbing of digits and are divided into fingers and toes, and with or without fusion.\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM codes report the same information, but separate out webbing and fusion into different code series. The ICD-10-CM codes also include laterality.\r\n\r\nFor fused toes on the right foot, report Q70.21. For webbed toes on the right foot, you would use code Q70.31. And so on.',

Apparently not everyone’s holiday celebration went off without a hitch.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Sweating-sun.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-2974\" alt=\"Sweating sun\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Sweating-sun-292x300.jpg\" width=\"243\" height=\"249\" /></a>First in to the clinic is Karin, who took advantage of the nice weekend weather to climb a mountain. The mountain wasn’t in the mood, however, and decided to send an avalanche of small rocks raining down on Karin. She subsequently slipped and slid her way back down to the bottom of the mountain.\r\n\r\nFortunately, Karin suffered only minor injuries during her rapid descent. Dr. Carroll documents the following:\r\n\r\nFemale patient seen for initial visit after fall down mountain. Patient suffered abrasions to the right forearm, right palm, right cheek. No sign of head trauma or concussion. Right wrist is swollen. X-rays confirm no fracture. Grade 1 carpal sprain. Patient also suffered lacerations to left cheek, right index, and right middle fingers, no foreign bodies in wounds.\r\n\r\nBased on that documentation, we can report the following codes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S50.811A, abrasion of right forearm, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S60.511A, abrasion of right hand, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S00.81A, abrasion of other part of head, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S63.511A, sprain of carpal joint of right wrist, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S01.412A, laceration without foreign body of left cheek and temporomandibular area, initial encounter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWhen we get to the lacerations of the fingers, we need to query Dr. Carroll. The laceration codes specify with and without damage to the nail. Some coders might assume that because Dr. Carroll didn’t mention nail damage, none is present. I’d rather ask and be sure.\r\n\r\nIn response to our query, Dr. Carroll confirms no damage to the nails. So we would report:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S61.210A, laceration without foreign body of right index finger without damage to nail, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S61.212A, laceration without foreign body of right middle finger without damage to nail,  initial encounter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThat brings us to Dave, whose cookout didn’t turn out so well. He was carrying his perfectly marinated steak tips out to the grill when his cat Grace made a play for some attention using that age-old cat trick of twining about Dave’s feet. Dave tripped, sending the steak tips flying and Grace running for cover.\r\n\r\nDave unfortunately landed on the fork he was planning to use on the steak tips and instead got skewered in the stomach. After an uncomfortable night, he decided to come in to see Dr. Barbie Que.\r\n\r\nWhat do we need to see in Dr. Que’s documentation to code Dave’s mishap?\r\n\r\nFirst off, we need to know how deep the puncture is. Did it penetrate the peritoneal cavity? Next, what part of the abdomen did the fork find? Our choices are:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Right upper quadrant</li>\r\n	<li>Left upper quadrant</li>\r\n	<li>Right lower quadrant</li>\r\n	<li>Left  lower quadrant</li>\r\n	<li>Periumbilic region</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe do have a choice for unspecified as an absolutely last resort.\r\n\r\nWe also need to know the encounter: initial, subsequent, or sequela.  And finally we need to know whether a foreign body is present.\r\n\r\nAfter reviewing Dr. Que’s notes, we learn this is an initial visit for a puncture wound to the right lower quadrant. The puncture did not penetrate the peritoneal cavity, but a foreign body (part of the fork) was found. That leads us to code S31.143 (puncture wound of abdominal wall with foreign body, right lower quadrant without penetration into peritoneal cavity).\r\n\r\nI wouldn’t want to be in Grace’s fur when Dave gets home.',

Like many of the other codes in ICD-10-CM, phobia codes are very specific. They allow you to code for the precise cause of the patient’s fear.\r\n\r\nFor example, a patient suffers from arachnophobia (fear of spiders), so we would report F40.210.\r\n\r\nFor a patient with a fear of flying, we would report F40.243.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to agoraphobia, ICD-10-CM includes multiple choices depending on the patient’s exact condition. Depending on the documentation, we could report:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>F40.00, agoraphobia, unspecified</li>\r\n	<li>F40.01, agoraphobia with panic disorder</li>\r\n	<li>F40.02, agoraphobia without panic disorder</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBefore reporting F40.00 (unspecified), query the physician. We don’t know how payers will handle unspecified codes in ICD-10-CM, but it seems counterproductive to use unspecified codes after we more to a more specific coding system.\r\n\r\nWe also find this Excludes1 note under code F40.01:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Excludes1: panic disorder without agoraphobia (F41.0)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBecause there are more than 500 phobias, ICD-10-CM doesn’t have a specific code for every phobia.\r\n\r\nWhen we don’t have a code for a specific phobia, we can report one of the following:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>F40.218, other animal type phobia (for instance, the above-mentioned snakes)</li>\r\n	<li>F40.228, other natural environment type phobia</li>\r\n	<li>F40.232, fear of other medical care</li>\r\n	<li>F40.248, other situational type phobia</li>\r\n	<li>F40.298, other specified phobias</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese codes are not the dreaded unspecified codes. They are “not elsewhere classified” codes. The physician documented the condition, we just don’t have a code for it.\r\n\r\nAnd no, ICD-10-CM doesn’t have a code for fear of a new coding system.

No more sharing with the ears, hear that?\r\n\r\nOne of the first things you’ll notice in the chapter on diseases of the eyes is the significant increase in the number of codes. We see that everywhere in ICD-10-CM, so it’s really not a surprise.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/CartoonEyes1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-2857\" alt=\"CartoonEyes\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/CartoonEyes1.jpg\" width=\"171\" height=\"176\" /></a>The increased number of codes isn’t as scary as you might think. In many cases, the increase is simply due to the addition of laterality.\r\n\r\nFor example, a patient comes in with dacryops (excess tears). In ICD-9-CM, we have one code: 375.11.\r\n\r\nIn ICD-10-CM, we’ll choose from these four codes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>H04.111, dacryops of right lacrimal gland</li>\r\n	<li>H04.112, dacryops of left lacrimal gland</li>\r\n	<li>H04.113, dacryops of bilateral lacrimal glands</li>\r\n	<li>H04.119, dacryops of unspecified lacrimal gland</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe only difference is laterality—which eye is affected. Hopefully, our physicians are documenting that information now. Pull some records and find out. If they are, great, that’s one less thing to worry about when we transition to ICD-10-CM.\r\n\r\nIf they aren’t, start querying for it now. If the physician answers the query, great, it’s more information in the patient’s record. If the physician doesn’t respond, you can still code the record and get the bill out the door. Either way, you’re training them for ICD-10-CM.\r\n\r\nThe same holds true for many of the conditions of the eye, such as blepharochalasis (inflammation of the eyelid). In ICD-9-CM, we again have only one code choice: 374.46.\r\n\r\nThe ICD-10-CM codes not only specify right and left eye, they also denote upper and lower eyelid:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>H02.30, blepharochalasis unspecified eye, unspecified eyelid</li>\r\n	<li>H02.31, blepharochalasis right upper eyelid</li>\r\n	<li>H02.32, blepharochalasis right lower eyelid</li>\r\n	<li>H02.33, blepharochalasis right eye, unspecified eyelid</li>\r\n	<li>H02.34, blepharochalasis left upper eyelid</li>\r\n	<li>H02.35, blepharochalasis left lower eyelid</li>\r\n	<li>H02.36, blepharochalasis left eye, unspecified eyelid</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSo we’ve gone from one code to seven with the addition of one piece of information: the specific site of the inflammation.\r\n\r\nAs a side note, you should rarely, if ever, report H02.03 (unspecified eye, unspecified eyelid). Really, the physician should be documenting that information. If he or she isn’t, query. I doubt many payers are going to reimburse for H02.03 for long. After all, one reason to move to ICD-10-CM is the increased specificity.\r\n\r\nCataracts aren’t quite as clear a transition. In ICD-9-CM, we have numerous codes under the category cataracts (366) divided into these subcategories:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>366.0, infantile juvenile and presenile cataract</li>\r\n	<li>366.1, senile cataract</li>\r\n	<li>366.2, traumatic cataract</li>\r\n	<li>366.3, cataract secondary to ocular disorders</li>\r\n	<li>366.4, cataract associated with other disorders</li>\r\n	<li>366.5, after-cataract</li>\r\n	<li>366.8, other cataract</li>\r\n	<li>366.9, unspecified cataract</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nEach subcategory includes multiple codes with more specificity.\r\n\r\nHowever, ICD-10-CM breaks cataracts into two main categories:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>H25, age-related cataract</li>\r\n	<li>H26, other cataract</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAge-related cataracts further divide into:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>H25.0, age-related incipient cataract</li>\r\n	<li>H25.1, age-related nuclear cataract</li>\r\n	<li>H25.2, age-related cataract, morgagnian type</li>\r\n	<li>H25.8, other age-related cataract</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nUnder other cataracts, you’ll find these main subcategories:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>H26.0, infantile and juvenile cataract</li>\r\n	<li>H26.1, traumatic cataract</li>\r\n	<li>H26.2, complicated cataract</li>\r\n	<li>H26.3, drug-induced cataract</li>\r\n	<li>H26.4, secondary cataract</li>\r\n	<li>H26.8, other specified cataract</li>\r\n	<li>H26.9, unspecified cataract</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nFor both age-related and other cataracts, we need to know which eye is affected. Many of the other details are similar to ICD-9-CM, just organized in a slightly different fashion. For example, in both ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM, traumatic cataracts break down into:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Localized</li>\r\n	<li>Partially resolved</li>\r\n	<li>Total</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nICD-10-CM adds laterality and an additional subcategory for unspecified (again, you should query for more specifics before you report an unspecified code).\r\n\r\nLook at your current records to see whether you can code them in ICD-10-CM. As long as your physicians are documenting laterality, you should be good to go. You’ll just need to remember to look for that detail when you code in ICD-10-CM.\r\n\r\nIf they aren’t documenting laterality, start asking for it now. By the time we switch to ICD-10-CM, they’ll be used to documenting it.\r\n\r\nBy the way, you don’t need to tell them you’re asking for laterality because of ICD-10-CM. Just ask. You might be surprised by the response.',

For ED encounters, the LIDOS is the date the patient enters the ED.\r\n\r\nFor observation encounters, it is the date that observation care begins.\r\n\r\nCMS also issued <a href=\"https://questions.cms.gov/faq.php?id=5005&amp;faqId=8248\">an FAQ regarding HIPAA compliance</a> for claims submitted with ICD-9 code after October 1, 2014. The short answer: The date of service determines which code set coders should use regardless of the date the claim is filed or submitted.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://questions.cms.gov/faq.php?id=5005&amp;faqId=8252\">The third FAQ</a> deals with the common question of how long will ICD-9 codes hang around after October 1, 2014. CMS’ answer, not surprisingly, is that it depends on your payer.',

I just saw a flotilla of ducks take out one of the counselors (ICD-10-CM code W61.62, struck by duck).\r\n\r\nI went hiking with Jim Spivey; he developed poison ivy (L23.7, allergic contact dermatitis due to plants, except food). You remember Leo Spinner; he got ptomaine poisoning last night after dinner (A05.1, botulism food poisoning). The food here is awful!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/camp-fire.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-3492\" alt=\"camp fire\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/camp-fire-263x300.jpg\" width=\"263\" height=\"300\" /></a>All the counselors hate the waiters and one got bitten by a gator (W58.01xA, bitten by alligator, initial encounter). The head coach wants no sissies, so he reads to us from something called “Ulysses,” which gave Harry Hole nightmares and he won’t stop screaming (F51.5, nightmare disorder). This is child abuse (T74.32, child psychological abuse, confirmed)!\r\n\r\nNow I don’t want this to scare ya, but my bunkmate has malaria. He claims he caught it during a trip to Papua New Guinea and has brain damage because of it (B50.0, plasmodium falciparum malaria with cerebral complications). I think he really got a different form in Mexico (B51.9, plasmodium vivax malaria without complication) and is just a liar.\r\n\r\nYou remember Jimmy Harvey? They’re about to organize a search party for him. He wandered off during this morning’s hike (probably because he couldn’t see anything in the rain). I think he fell over a cliff (W15.xxxA, fall from cliff, initial encounter) and broke his neck (S12.040A, displaced lateral mass fracture of first cervical vertebra, initial encounter).\r\n\r\nTake me home. Oh Mother, Father, take me home. I hate Murky Water! Don’t leave me out in the forest where I might get eaten by a bear (W55.81xA, bitten by other mammals, initial encounter) or bitten by a raccoon (W55.51xA, bitten by raccoon, initial encounter).\r\n\r\nDearest Father, darling Mother, how’s my precious little brother? I did not stick that fork in his hand (S61.431A, puncture wound without foreign body of right hand, initial encounter) and if he still says I did, he’s lying!\r\n\r\nWait a minute, it stopped hailing and some guys are going sailing. Oh no, they forgot to check the boat and they’re going down! They’re drowning (W69, accidental drowning and submersion while in natural water). Don’t look now, but the alligators are after them too!\r\n\r\nHelp me!!',

Apparently, the previous treatment to restrict blood flow to the aneurysm was unsuccessful. So Dr. Jannetta decides clip the aneurysm to stop the flow of blood.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/6_BrainWithArteries-no-label.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-3496\" alt=\"6_BrainWithArteries-no label\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/6_BrainWithArteries-no-label-300x300.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a>This procedure involves applying a clip to the aneurysm so blood no longer flows to it.\r\n\r\nOur first character for our ICD-10-PCS code will be 0, because we are in the medical/surgical section.\r\n\r\nOur second character denotes the body part. We’re dealing with upper arteries, so our second character is 3. In ICD-10-PCS, the diaphragm is the dividing line for upper and lower.\r\n\r\nOur third character is the root operation. What is the objective of the procedure? In this case, Dr. Jannetta wants to completely cut off the blood supply to a vessel. That gives us a root operation Occlusion (L).\r\n\r\nSo far, we have 03L for our code. Now we can look at the specific code table.\r\n\r\nIn order to code the procedure, we need to know which specific vessel Dr. Jannetta is treating. Our choices for body system Upper Arteries include:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>G, intracranial artery</li>\r\n	<li>H, common carotid artery, right</li>\r\n	<li>J, common carotid artery, left</li>\r\n	<li>K, internal carotid artery, right</li>\r\n	<li>L, internal carotid artery, left</li>\r\n	<li>M, external carotid artery, right</li>\r\n	<li>N, external carotid artery, left</li>\r\n	<li>P, vertebral artery, right</li>\r\n	<li>Q, vertebral artery, left</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIn Dr. Jannetta’s documentation, he specifies the right middle cerebral artery. That’s not one of our choices. Now what? Time to check Appendix C in the ICD-10-PCS Manual. This helpful section provides a list of anatomical terms and their corresponding ICD-10-PCS descriptions. If you aren’t sure where a body part is located, head to Appendix C.\r\n\r\nThe middle cerebral artery is an intracranial artery, which gives us a fourth character: G.\r\n\r\nWe also need to know the approach:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>0, open</li>\r\n	<li>3, percutaneous</li>\r\n	<li>4, percutaneous endoscopic</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nClipping an aneurysm is an open procedure, by its very nature. You can’t perform that procedure any other way, but Dr. Jannetta still needs to document his approach.\r\n\r\nFinally we need to know what type of device, if any, Dr. Jannetta used in the procedure:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>B, intraluminal device, bioactive</li>\r\n	<li>C, extraluminal device</li>\r\n	<li>D, intraluminal device</li>\r\n	<li>Z, no device</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nHere’s where it pays to be on good terms with your physician. If you can convince a brain surgeon to explain procedures to you and how he or she performs it (sort of a mini medical lecture), you’ll probably know what type of device that surgeon typically uses. Again, the physician still needs to document what device he or she used, if any.\r\n\r\nFor this case, Dr. Jannetta uses an extraluminal clip, so our sixth character is C.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that the surgeon may use a trade name for a device, so you may need to query (or hit the Web) to find out what type of device it is.\r\n\r\nFor this procedure the seventh character is easy. We only have one option: Z (no qualifier).\r\n\r\nIf we pull together our code, we get: 03LG0CZ (occlusion of intracranial artery with extraluminal device, open approach).\r\n\r\nWith that, Dr. Jannetta stitches up Betsy and sends her off to recovery, while we get to call it a day.',

		'body' : 'HHS and the American Medical Association (AMA) seem to be playing a game of chicken when it comes to ICD-10 implementation. Last year, HHS swerved and the implementation date was moved from October 1, 2013, to October 1, 2014. HHS is standing firm (for now) on the 2014 date, but that hasn’t stopped the AMA from continuing its crusade to halt ICD-10.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Tug-of-war.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-3501\" alt=\"Tug of war\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Tug-of-war-300x178.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"178\" /></a>At both the AHIMA ICD-10-CM/PCS and CAC Summit and the HIMSS Media ICD-10 Forum, HHS representatives repeated that the 2014 date is the final date and no plans currently exist to extend the deadline again.\r\n\r\n“I have absolutely no reason to believe that the ICD-10 deadline will move again,” Denise Buenning, MsM, director of CMS’s administrative simplification group in the office of e-health standards and services said to the AHIMA attendees.\r\n\r\nFarzad Mostashari, the national coordinator for healthcare IT, told the HIMSS conference attendees “there are no plans for any more extensions.”\r\n\r\nWe’ve heard that before. And HHS has caved before under pressure from industry groups.\r\n\r\nThe AMA led the pack back in 2011, when the AMA’s House of Delegates voted to “work vigorously to stop implementation of ICD-10” during the closing session of its semi-annual policy-making meeting. The AMA worked so vigorously, in fact, that it convinced HHS to delay implementation by one year.\r\n\r\nAt one point, the AMA considered lobbying to move straight from ICD-9 to ICD-11. I thought that plan went out the window in May when the Board of Trustees recommended not skipping ICD-10. However, the AMA’s House of Delegates rejected that report during its meeting last week.\r\n\r\nSo the AMA is continuing to push for an end to ICD-10 and is now throwing support behind legislation to stop the implementation of ICD-10 and remain with ICD-9 until ICD-11 can be properly evaluated.\r\n\r\nCongress is even getting in on the act, with two bills that would stop ICD-10 implementation currently under consideration. The AMA is backing the Cutting Costly Codes Act, introduced by Rep. Ted Poe, R-Texas.\r\n\r\nThe AMA wants a two-year phase-in to implement ICD-10 or ICD-11 (note the AMA is leaving its ICD-11 options open). The phase-in would also mean that payers couldn’t penalize providers for coding errors and unspecified codes. It also would help physicians get over the “sticker shock” of implementation, according to Reid B. Blackwelder, MD, president-elect of the American Academy of Family Physicians.\r\n\r\nICD-10 isn’t something HHS just sprang on the industry out of the blue. We’ve know this was coming since 2003 when AAPC and AHIMA field tested ICD-10. Physicians, facilities, and payers were all warned and urged to start planning way back then.\r\n\r\nApparently few people took that advice to heart. Recent surveys, including one conducted by TrustHCS and AHIMA, show that the industry as a whole is not on track to implement ICD-10 by October 1, 2014.\r\n\r\nIn the past several years, providers and payers have dealt with EMR implementation, HIPAA 5010, and of course, revenue cuts. But we can’t keep putting off ICD-10.\r\n\r\nICD-9 is out of room (and hasn’t been updated in two years). The diagnosis codes do not accurately reflect severity of illness and the ICD-9-CM procedure codes are incredibly non-specific.\r\n\r\nProviders and payers face plenty of challenges with ICD-10 implementation-- training, productivity decreases, implementation and testing costs, to name a few.\r\n\r\nThe benefits of implementing ICD-10 far outweigh those costs. Better documentation will hopefully result in better patient care because physicians will have specific information about the patient’s condition.\r\n\r\nInstead of just documenting “diabetes,” physicians will need to specify the type of diabetes and any related conditions.\r\n\r\nIdeally, that improved specificity about the patient’s condition will result in more accurate reimbursement (that’s a big wish bordering on an impossible dream, I know, but as Walt Disney said, dream big.)\r\n\r\nPayers and providers have already spent a considerable amount of money preparing for ICD-10. Admittedly, many still have a long way to go, but stopping ICD-10 isn’t the answer.\r\n\r\nLet’s hope the AMA is the one to swerve this time.',

Unfortunately for Joe, the parade started late and he was sitting in the sun the convertible that he was supposed to drive in down the parade route. No one thought to tell him to wait it out in the shade.\r\n\r\nAfter reviewing Joe’s symptoms of dizziness, headache, dry mouth, and thirst, Dr. Sam diagnoses him with moderate dehydration. He also notices Joe has a second-degree sunburn on the top of his bald head. Ouch.\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM includes only one code for dehydration: E86.0.\r\n\r\nThe sunburn is a different story. We have four choices, depending on what degree of sunburn our patient suffered:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>L55.0, sunburn of first degree</li>\r\n	<li>L55.1, sunburn of second degree</li>\r\n	<li>L55.2, sunburn of third degree</li>\r\n	<li>L55.9, sunburn, unspecified</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nDr. Sam documented second degree, so we code L55.1. Some fluids and burn ointment fix Joe right up and we’ll give him a Fix ‘Em Up Clinic hat to protect his head in the future.\r\n\r\nOur next group of patients came in after falling ill at the Von Trapp family picnic. It seems Maria didn’t keep the beef and chicken refrigerated and the whole group came down with salmonellosis (A02.0, salmonella enteritis).\r\n\r\nAll of the Von Trapps displayed the same group of symptoms, but to varying degrees. Should we code the nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, chills, and headache for each patient? The answer (as you probably know) is no. Those symptoms are inherent to the disease and should not be reported separately.\r\n\r\nNote for next year’s picnic: assign Maria to cleanup instead of cooking.\r\n\r\nOur final patient today, Ralph, apparently did not pay attention to the “do not try this at home” warning. He attempted to create his own backyard extravaganza and ended up blowing off two fingers. Ralph immediately traveled to the Acme ED last night for initial treatment by Dr. Boom and is being seen today for a follow-up by Dr. Sam.\r\n\r\nWe know that Ralph suffered a traumatic amputation. In order to code his accident we also need to know:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Was the amputation complete or total?</li>\r\n	<li>Which hand was involved?</li>\r\n	<li>Which specific fingers were involved?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nDr. Sam documents he is seeing Ralph for a follow-up visit for complete traumatic amputation of the right index finger and partial amputation of the right middle finger caused by exploding fireworks.\r\n\r\nThat gives us codes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S68.110A, complete traumatic metacarpophalangeal amputation of right index finger, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S68.122A, partial traumatic metacarpophalangeal amputation of right middle finger, initial encounter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThis is a follow-up treatment for Ralph’s injuries, so why are we calling it an initial visit? Because the ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting tell us to add the seventh character of A when a patient is receiving active treatment including:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Surgical treatment</li>\r\n	<li>ED encounter</li>\r\n	<li>Treatment by a new physician</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nDr. Boom saw Ralph in the ED, today Dr. Sam is treating him at the clinic. An initial visit with a doctor means you append A as the seventh character.\r\n\r\nAnd with that, we will close the clinic for the day and hope you all stayed safer during your holiday celebrations.',

You’ll find them under Complications in the ICD-9-CM Alphabetic Index.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, those codes don’t really tell us much. We know the hemorrhage or hematoma complicated the surgery, but we don’t know where it occurred. That will change in ICD-10-CM.\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM contains numerous codes for hemorrhage or hematoma complicating surgery, based on location.  Also, you won’t find all of the complication codes grouped together. Instead, ICD-10-CM includes them in the section related to the body part.\r\n\r\nFor example, the codes for an intraoperative hemorrhage of the ear are:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>H95.21, intraoperative hemorrhage and hematoma of ear and mastoid process complicating a procedure on the ear and mastoid process</li>\r\n	<li>H95.22, intraoperative hemorrhage and hematoma of ear and mastoid process complicating other procedure</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe codes for an intraoperative hemorrhage of the nervous system are:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>G97.31, intraoperative hemorrhage and hematoma of a nervous system organ or structure complicating a nervous system procedure</li>\r\n	<li>G97.32, intraoperative hemorrhage and hematoma of a nervous system organ or structure complicating other procedure</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou probably also noticed that the codes specify not only where the hemorrhage occurred, but also what kind of procedure the bleed complicated.\r\n\r\nSo if the hemorrhage occurred in the right eye and it complicated an ophthalmic procedure, you would report H59.111.\r\n\r\nIf a hemorrhage occurred in the left eye complicating another procedure, report H59.122.\r\n\r\nThe eyes also pose a challenge because you need laterality as well. Was the bleed in the left eye, right eye, both eyes, or unspecified? You don’t need that detail for the ears though, just the eyes.\r\n\r\nHopefully, your surgeons are not prone to accidental hemorrhages or hematomas and you won’t need to use these codes often. If you do, you can find them by looking under Complications in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index. Once you’ve found the term under Complication, move down to Intraoperative, and then to the specific system or site where the hemorrhage or hematoma occurred.',

Depending on the documentation, you will assign one of the following as the seventh character for all codes in the H40.10, H40.11, H40.12, H40.13, and H40.14 series:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>0, stage unspecified</li>\r\n	<li>1, mild stage</li>\r\n	<li>2, moderate stage</li>\r\n	<li>3, severe stage</li>\r\n	<li>4, indeterminate stage</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nNote that unspecified and indeterminate are two different things.

So true or false: you should never report a nonspecific code.\r\n\r\nActually, it’s false. In some cases, coders can and should report Sign/symptom and “unspecified” codes.\r\n\r\nAccording to the ICD-10-CM guidelines, signs/symptoms or unspecified codes sometimes best reflect a patient encounter. That being said, you should always code to the highest level of specificity. Don’t just default to a nonspecific code so you can get the bill out the door.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/guidelines1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-3311\" alt=\"guidelines\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/guidelines1-300x170.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"170\" /></a>However, sometimes physicians can’t come up with a definitive diagnosis. They just can’t say what’s wrong with the patient. Maybe they are waiting for a lab test or a radiology report. Maybe the patient’s symptoms are so vague the physician can’t pick a single diagnosis. Or the conditions could be so similar the physician can’t choose.\r\n\r\nWhen the physician can’t assign a definitive diagnosis, coders should report codes for sign(s) and/or symptom(s). Remember though if you have a definitive diagnosis, you can’t code signs or symptoms that are integral to the diagnosis.\r\n\r\nA patient comes complaining of lower right quadrant abdominal pain. If the physician can’t determine the cause of the pain, report ICD-10-CM code R10.31.\r\n\r\nWhat happens if the physician documents the patient has an acute appendicitis with lower right quadrant pain and generalized peritonitis? You would report K35.2 for the appendicitis, but not R10.31. Abdominal pain is an integral symptom of appendicitis.\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM also includes plenty of details about infectious diseases, including causative organisms (think botulism or salmonella) or types (such as pneumonia).\r\n\r\nIf a physician diagnoses a patient with pneumonia, but doesn’t know the specific type, coders should assign an unspecified code (J18.9, pneumonia, unspecified organism).\r\n\r\nReport an unspecified code when it most accurately reflects what the provider knows about the patient’s condition at the time of that particular encounter. Do not select a specific code that is not supported by the medical record.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;',

I was hoping that one choice would emerge as a clear winner, but no such luck. Personally, I don’t think CMS will move the date, but I’ve been wrong before.\r\n\r\nThat leads to a second, equally important question: If CMS holds to October 1, 2014, will everyone be ready? Based on other surveys and talk at recent conferences, the answer to that question is probably no.\r\n\r\nThe big healthcare organizations, such as the Kaiser Permanentes, Ascensions, and Cleveland Clinics of the healthcare world, probably will be ready. They have more resources available to create and carry out a transition plan. The scope of the transition is bigger for them, so they probably are not waiting until the last minute.\r\n\r\nSmaller healthcare organizations, such as one- or two-physician practices, critical access hospitals, and small standalone acute care facilities, may not be ready. Physicians seem resistant to the transition and the American Medical Association is lobbying hard to prevent it from happening. Some small organizations just don’t have the resources to plan and complete the transition far in advance.\r\n\r\nAlmost 56% of the 1,200 practices that responded to a <a href=\"http://www.mgma.com/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=1374753\">Medical Group Management Association (MGMA) survey</a> indicated they had not yet begun ICD-10 implementation. MGMA released the survey in June.\r\n\r\nA little more than 38% of the respondents believe major health plans will not be ready October 1, 2014. Not all of the numbers are bad. More than 60% of respondents were extremely confident, confident or somewhat confident that their practice management vendor and electronic health records vendor would be ready for the transition.\r\n\r\nThe majority of respondents do not plan to begin ICD-10 training for any of their staff before January 1, 2014. It’s interesting to note that 2.6% do not plan any education for clinical staff.',

His symptoms are vague and could point to a lot of different ailments.\r\n\r\nAfter further questioning by Dr. C. Shore, Eric revealed that he saw jellyfish in the area where he was swimming. He thinks he may have come into contact with one. Dr. Shore diagnosis the toxic effects of contact with a jellyfish.\r\n\r\nNot surprisingly, ICD-10-CM includes a code for that. Actually, it includes eight codes that each require a seventh character. You’ll find the codes in the T63.6 (toxic effect of contact with other venomous marine animals) series and you need to choose between:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Toxic effect of contact with Portuguese Man-o-war (T63.61)</li>\r\n	<li>Toxic effect of contact with other jellyfish (T63.62)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nEric is certain he was not stung by a Portuguese Man-o-war, so we know we’re in the T63.62 series.

Eric wasn’t trying to hurt himself, so we can eliminate T63.622. Based on Eric’s statement that he accidentally swam into the jellyfish, we’ll go with T63.621A. The seventh character denotes the encounter. This is Eric’s first visit for treatment, so we add A for initial encounter.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Beach-and-umbrella.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-3541\" alt=\"Beach and umbrella\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Beach-and-umbrella-300x200.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a>Our next patient, 14-year-old Samantha, apparently thought a crab on the beach was dead, so she poked it—repeatedly. The crab was not pleased and tried to take off the offending digit. The crab was only partially successful, although it did succeed in sending Samantha screaming back to her mother.\r\n\r\nIn order to code this encounter, we need to know:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Partial or complete amputation</li>\r\n	<li>Which hand</li>\r\n	<li>Which specific finger</li>\r\n	<li>Encounter type (initial, subsequent, sequela)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nDr. Shore documents an initial encounter for a partial amputation of the right index finger, which leads us to S68.120A (partial traumatic metacarpophalangeal amputation of right index finger, initial encounter).\r\n\r\nWe can also add these External Causes codes for Samantha’s injury:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>W56.81xA, bitten by other nonvenomous marine animals, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>Y92.832, beach as the place of occurrence of the external cause</li>\r\n	<li>Y99.8, other external cause status (leisure activity)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nICD-10-CM does not include codes for poking a crab or examining a presumed dead animal and we don’t know what Samantha was supposed to be doing instead of annoying sleeping crabs. So we can’t add an activity code without more information.\r\n\r\nToday’s last patient also suffered a marine animal mishap, but this time, a seagull was indirectly to blame.\r\n\r\nBob was out scavenging for seashells and sea glass for his artwork when he spotted a group of seagulls having clams for lunch. The gulls would take off, drop the clams on the rocks to break them, then swoop in and consume the exposed inner clam.\r\n\r\nNot all of the seagulls were on target and not all of the clams simply broke open. Bob had the misfortune of stepping on a sliver of clam shell, which sliced open the bottom of his bare foot. Of course, Bob was forced to flee the beach, picking up plenty of sand and other debris along the way, giving new meaning to suffering artist.\r\n\r\nWe know Bob suffered a laceration to the bottom of his foot. Were his toes involved? If yes, we’ll need to add a code or codes for those injuries. Luckily for Bob, he only lacerated his foot. However, some of the sand remained in the cut and Dr. Shore had to remove it (Bob is not the strong, silent type).\r\n\r\nWe also need to know which foot Bob injured and the encounter type. In Dr. Shore’s notes, he documented an initial visit for a 3 cm laceration of the left foot with foreign material.\r\n\r\nThat gives us code S91.322A (laceration with foreign body, left foot, initial encounter).\r\n\r\nBe aware that the codes will vary by:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Location on the body</li>\r\n	<li>Laterality</li>\r\n	<li>Type of wound</li>\r\n	<li>With or without foreign body</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe can also report some external cause codes for Bob, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>W22.8xxA, striking against or struck by other objects, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>Y92.832, beach as the place of occurrence of the external cause</li>\r\n	<li>Y93.01, activity, walking, marching and hiking</li>\r\n	<li>Y99.0, civilian activity done for income or pay</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nA quick word about the first and last codes on this list. When you look up stepping on an object in the Alphabetic Index, you are directed to W22.8. That’s the code we’ll use even though the definition doesn’t seem exactly correct.\r\n\r\nThe Y99.0 code is open to debate a little, too. Bob said he was looking for material for his artwork. We would report Y99.0 if he sells his artwork because scavenging shells could be considered a work activity. If he creates art for art’s sake, we would use Y99.8 (other external cause status).\r\n\r\nJust remember the next time you’re at the beach: avoid the jellyfish, don’t poke the marine life, and stay away from seagulls.',

You won’t believe what he tried this time.\r\n\r\nWile E.’s plan involved dropping an anvil from a weather balloon onto the Roadrunner. Once airborne, Wile E. quickly spotted his potential prey and loosed the anvil. He apparently failed to consider that without the anvil’s weight, his balloon would rapidly rise. In the process, the string holding the balloon closed—and thus inflated—unfurled. If you’ve even seen what happens when a balloon loses its air, you know what happened next.<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/falling-anvil.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-3548\" alt=\"falling anvil\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/falling-anvil-212x300.jpg\" width=\"212\" height=\"300\" /></a>\r\n\r\nWile E. took a wild ride as the balloon deflated, then crashed to Earth when it finally ran out of air. To add insult to injury, the anvil he attempted to drop on the Roadrunner instead fell on him. Ouch.\r\n\r\nNow we get to code the poor coyote’s injuries. Wile E. suffered two distinct sets of injuries: one from the crash landing and one from the anvil falling on his head. We’ll deal with the crash-related injuries first.\r\n\r\nDr. T. Byrd documents an initial visit for multiple injuries caused by a fall from a significant height, including two broken legs, torn knee ligaments, and a dislocated hip.\r\n\r\nFor the leg fractures, we need to know:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Open or closed</li>\r\n	<li>Displaced or non-displaced</li>\r\n	<li>Specific location of the fracture for each leg</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nDr. Byrd excels at documentation and provides the following information:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Closed comminuted displaced tib-fib fracture of the left leg</li>\r\n	<li>Type II open displaced medial condyle fracture of the right femur</li>\r\n	<li>Grade 3 sprains of ACL, MCL right knee</li>\r\n	<li>Obturator dislocation of right hip</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe have everything we need to code for Wile E.’s injuries, although some of Dr. Byrd’s notes may need a little translation. A tib-fib fracture involves both the tibia and the fibula. A comminuted fracture means the bones are broken in multiple places. ICD-10-CM does include comminuted in the code descriptions for tibia and fibula fractures. We will need to code each fracture separately, even though Dr. Byrd included them on one line.\r\n\r\nA grade 3 sprain is usually called a complete tear. Don’t let that confuse you when you code the injury. When you look up Tear, ligament, in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index, it directs you to Sprain. We need to code the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) sprains individually.\r\n\r\nFor Wile E.’s fall-related injuries, we would report:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S82.452A, displaced comminuted fracture of shaft of left fibula, initial encounter for a closed fracture</li>\r\n	<li>S82.252A, displaced comminuted fracture of shaft of left tibia, initial encounter for a closed fracture</li>\r\n	<li>S72.431B, displaced fracture of medial condyle of right femur, initial encounter for open fracture type I or II</li>\r\n	<li>S73.024A, obturator dislocation of right hip, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S83.511A, sprain of anterior cruciate ligament of right knee, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S83.521A, sprain of posterior cruciate ligament of right knee, initial encounter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAll of these codes require a seventh character to denote the encounter and for all but one code, that seventh character is A (initial encounter). For fracture codes, the seventh character not only indicates the encounter, but also whether the fracture is open or closed. Since the right femur fracture is open, we use seventh character B.\r\n\r\nFor open fractures, physicians must specify the type based on the Gustilo-Anderson classifications. However, if the physician does not identify the type of open fracture, default to B as your seventh character.\r\n\r\nNow that the fall is out of the way, we can look at the injuries caused by the falling anvil. Wile E.’s luck ran true in this case and the anvil landed on his head. Fortunately, Wile E. did not lose consciousness or suffer a traumatic brain injury.\r\n\r\nHe did end up with a concussion, a closed non-displaced fracture of the frontal and parietal bones, and a 5-cm scalp laceration with stone slivers embedded. For this part of Wile E.’s injuries we would report:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S06.0X0A, concussion without loss of consciousness, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S02.0XXA, fracture of vault of skull, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S01.02XA, laceration with foreign body of scalp, initial encounter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAgain, some things to note with these codes. Even though Wile E. suffered two skull fractures, ICD-10-CM classifies the frontal and parietal bones as the vault of the skull. So we only use one code.\r\n\r\nWe also need placeholders for these codes. They all require a seventh character, but don’t have six other characters. In these cases, we use an X placeholder to make sure the seventh character ends up in the seventh spot in the code. Otherwise the code is invalid and we don’t get paid.\r\n\r\nOur patched-up coyote is ready to head back into the wild in pursuit of his dinner. But really, Wile E., it’s time to choose a different entrée.',

		'body' : 'First we saw the new ICD-10-PCS codes and guidelines in May, followed by the new ICD-10-CM codes in June and the ICD-10-CM guidelines in July. Now we have updated general equivalence mappings (GEMs) from CMS for both<a href=\"http://cms.hhs.gov/Medicare/Coding/ICD10/2014-ICD-10-CM-and-GEMs.html\"> ICD-10-CM</a> and<a href=\"http://cms.hhs.gov/Medicare/Coding/ICD10/2014-ICD-10-PCS.html\"> ICD-10-PCS</a>.\r\n\r\nGEMs are a way to translate ICD-9 codes into ICD-10 codes and vice versa. The maps are a great tool and will get you to the correct code neighborhood, but they won’t always take you to the correct house. If you always had a one-to-one translation, moving to ICD-10 would be pointless.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/news01.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-3371\" alt=\"news01\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/news01-300x193.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"193\" /></a>In some cases, one ICD-9-CM code maps directly to one ICD-10-CM code. For example, paratyphoid fever A maps from ICD-9-CM code 002.1 directly to ICD-10-CM code A01.1.\r\n\r\nMore commonly, you’ll get a one-to-many match when you go from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM. For example, in ICD-9-CM, simple chronic conjunctivitis goes from one code (372.11) to four codes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>H10.421, simple chronic conjunctivitis, right eye</li>\r\n	<li>H10.422, simple chronic conjunctivitis, left eye</li>\r\n	<li>H10.423, simple chronic conjunctivitis, bilateral</li>\r\n	<li>H10.429, simple chronic conjunctivitis, unspecified eye</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou cannot code directly from the GEMs, but they will point you in the right direction. Look at your common diagnoses by ICD-9-CM code, then plug those codes into the GEMs and see where the GEMs take you. You can use the GEMs to familiarize yourself with the ICD-10-CM codes (and the ICD-10-PCS codes for inpatient procedures). You can also see what the ICD-10-CM options are for diagnoses you commonly report. That can help you educate your physicians about any additional documentation they will need to provide for ICD-10.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;',

She comes into the clinic because she is having contractions (and can’t wait to give birth). Dr. Stork admits Shannon to the maternity ward at Stitch ‘Em Up, where Shannon gives birth to a healthy baby girl.\r\n\r\nSince Shannon is apparently a pro at this baby business, we can happily report these two ICD-10-CM codes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>O80, encounter for full-term uncomplicated delivery</li>\r\n	<li>Z37.0, single live birth</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAll of the main pregnancy codes start with the letter O, not the number zero. It can be a little confusing if you forget that all ICD-10-CM codes begin with a letter. If you submit a code with a zero as the first character, the payer will kick it back as an invalid code.\r\n\r\nFor the ICD-10-PCS procedure code, we have a nice, easy, one-line table in the Obstetrics section of the manual. Make sure you go to section 1, not 0 (Medical and Surgical). Our ICD-10-PCS code is 10E0XZZ. You only report this code for a manually assisted or vaginal delivery without instrumentation.\r\n\r\nBack at the Fix ‘Em Up Clinic, Dr. Stork sees Rachel, a 29-year-old patient who is 38 weeks pregnant with her first child. Rachel conceived her child through in-vitro fertilization. Dr. Stork informs the happy (and relieved) mother-to-be that she can expect to deliver a healthy baby boy within the next three weeks.\r\n\r\nBecause Rachel conceived using in-vitro fertilization, she is considered a high-risk pregnancy, so we would report:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>O09.813, supervision of pregnancy resulting from assisted reproductive technology, third trimester</li>\r\n	<li>Z3A.38, 38 weeks gestation of pregnancy</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe Z3A- code is always an additional code only on the mother’s chart to indicate exact week of gestation.\r\n\r\nAlso note that Dr. Stork did not document third trimester. She only documented 38 weeks pregnant. That’s okay. We can use the weeks to indicate the trimester. Not sure where trimesters begin and end? No worries. ICD-10-CM helpfully includes this breakdown at the beginning of the pregnancy section:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>First trimester: less than 14 weeks, 0 days</li>\r\n	<li>Second trimester: 14 weeks, 0 days to less than 28 weeks, 0 days</li>\r\n	<li>Third trimester: 28 weeks, 0 days until delivery</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nTrimesters are counted from the first day of the last menstrual period.\r\n\r\nOur third patient, Melissa, is having a tougher time with her second pregnancy. Melissa is currently 33 weeks and four days into her second pregnancy. She is experiencing a constant headache and blurry vision. Dr. Stork examines Melissa and also finds her blood pressure is elevated.\r\n\r\nDr. Stork diagnosis mild pre-eclampsia. We need to know if Melissa has pre-existing hypertension  because that will change our code. When we review Melissa’s record, we find a note from Dr. Stork stating Melissa has no pre-existing conditions that would affect her pregnancy, so we would report:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>O14.03, mild to moderate pre-eclampsia, third trimester</li>\r\n	<li>Z3A.33, 33 weeks gestation of pregnancy</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nOur final patient for the day is Karin, a 29-year-old patient who is in the 22<sup>nd</sup> week of her first pregnancy—and she’s having twins!\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM codes for maternal care for multiple gestations start at O30-. In order to code for Karin’s visit, we need to know whether the twins are sharing one placenta (monochorionic) or if they each have their own (dichorionic) and whether they are sharing an amniotic sac (monoamniotic) or are in separate amniotic sacs (diamniotic).\r\n\r\nIn some cases the physician will not be able to tell. ICD-10-CM includes different series of codes if the physician doesn’t specify the number of placenta and amniotic sacs (O30.00-) and if the physician cannot determine the number (O30.09-). Make sure you read the documentation to determine which series of codes to use.\r\n\r\nDr. Stork documents one placenta, but two amniotic sacs, so we would report:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>O30.032, twin pregnancy, monochorionic/diamniotic, second trimester</li>\r\n	<li>Z3A.22, 22 weeks gestation of pregnancy</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThat’s all for our baby mamas for today. If you code a lot of pregnancies, be sure to read the guidelines for Chapter O in the ICD-10-CM Manual and take a look at the codes. ICD-10-CM includes specific codes for multiple pregnancies up to quadruplets, then adds a series for other specified multiple gestation (in case you treat Octomom).',

We still have to look up the actual code in the Tabular List.\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM codes can be up to seven characters in length. The Alphabetic Index rarely lists all seven.\r\n\r\nSometimes ICD-10-CM is nice enough to let us know we need additional characters by putting a dash at the end of the code in the Alphabetic Index. For example, if you look up unilateral conductive deafness, the Alphabetic Index gives you code H90.1-.\r\n\r\nWhen you look up H90.1- in the Tabular List, you find two choices:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>H90.11, conductive hearing loss, unilateral, right ear, with unrestricted hearing on the contralateral side</li>\r\n	<li>H90.12, conductive hearing loss, unilateral, left ear, with unrestricted hearing on the contralateral side</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nCoding life would be easy (well, easier) if ICD-10-CM did that for all of the codes that require additional characters. Alas, it does not.\r\n\r\nLook up gout, chronic, idiopathic, multiple sites in the Alphabetic Index. You see code M1A.09. That’s all. However, when you flip back to the Tabular List, you find out that you need a seventh character. Actually you need a sixth character placeholder and a seventh character to denote:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>0, without tophus (tophi)</li>\r\n	<li>1, with tophus (tophi)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nFor chronic idiopathic gout of multiple sites without tophus, you would report code M1A09X0.\r\n\r\nMost of the codes without the dash actually require placeholders. You can have up to three X placeholders in a single code. You’ll usually find those in the External Causes section, such as:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>W64.XXXA, exposure to other animate mechanical forces, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>W73.XXXD, other specified cause of accidental non-transport drowning and submersion, subsequent encounter</li>\r\n	<li>W85.XXXS, exposure to electric transmission lines, sequela</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nDon’t be fooled by the lack of a dash.

He comes in to see Dr. Sunni Daze complaining of pain in his right elbow. Dr. Daze diagnoses golfer’s elbow and prescribes physical therapy and anti-inflammatory drugs.\r\n\r\nThe ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index includes golfer’s elbow, but directs us to epicondylitis, medial. As a side note, you’ll also find tennis elbow in the Alphabetic Index with a note to see epicondylitis, lateral.\r\n\r\nWe have three possible choices for Todd’s condition, but because the documentation specifies the right elbow, we would report:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>M77.01, medial epicondylitis, right elbow</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nOur next patient, Bob, arrives still wearing his summer league baseball uniform. Bob tells Dr. Daze that he was rounding second base and trying for third when he heard a popping sound followed by “excruciating pain” in his left heel.\r\n\r\nAfter a thorough examination, Dr. Daze diagnoses a ruptured Achilles tendon. ICD-9-CM classifies an acute traumatic rupture or tear of a tendon as a sprain. ICD-10-CM classifies it as a strain. So off to strain, tendon, we go. Only to discover that we really need to look up Injury, muscle, by site, strain.\r\n\r\nBut wait, we don’t have a muscle specified. Dr. Daze specified a rupture of the Achilles tendon. Now what? Fortunately, under Injury in the Alphabetic Index, we find an entry for Achilles tendon directing us to code series S86.01-.\r\n\r\nWe know this is the left Achilles tendon and is an initial visit, which means we will report:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S86.012A, strain of left Achilles tendon, initial encounter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe Anytown Skateboard Park has sent plenty of business our way this summer and today is no exception. Steven was showing off what he thought were his mad skateboarding skills when a twig on the ramp took him down.\r\n\r\nSteven broke his fall by putting out both hands and also broke his wrist and suffered assorted other scrapes and bruises. Fortunately, he was wearing a helmet and thus avoided a concussion and any serious brain injury.\r\n\r\nWhat information do we need in order to code Steven’s broken wrist? In general, to code fractures in ICD-10-CM, we need to know:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Right or left</li>\r\n	<li>Open or closed</li>\r\n	<li>Displaced or non-displaced</li>\r\n	<li>Specific bone and where on the bone</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nLet’s see what Dr. Daze documented.\r\n\r\nInitial visit for 18-year-old male, fell from skateboard at park. Suffered abrasions to left palm, right palm, left knee. X-rays confirm Colles’ fracture of right arm, rules out other fractures.\r\n\r\nSteven suffered a Colles’ fracture, which is actually a fracture of the distal end of the radius. ICD-10-CM includes specific codes for Colles’ fractures, as well as Smith’s fractures and Barton’s fractures.\r\n\r\nBecause Dr. Daze specified a Colles’ fracture, we only have three main choices:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S52.531, Colles\' fracture of right radius</li>\r\n	<li>S52.532, Colles\' fracture of left radius</li>\r\n	<li>S52.539, Colles\' fracture of unspecified radius</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe know Steven fractured his right radius and this is an initial visit, so our final code would be S52.531A (Colles\' fracture of right radius, initial encounter).\r\n\r\nWe also need to code Steven’s other injuries, and since Dr. Daze helpfully indicated laterality, we would code:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S60.511A, abrasion of right hand, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S60.512A, abrasion of left hand, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S80.212A, abrasion, left knee, initial encounter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIn ICD-9-CM, we look up abrasions by going to injury, superficial, by site. In ICD-10-CM, we can just look up abrasion and find the entire list of abrasion codes.\r\n\r\nBecause we know where Steven was and what he was doing when he was injured, we can also add some external causes codes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>V00.131A, fall from skateboard, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>Y93.51, activity, roller skating (inline) and skateboarding</li>\r\n	<li>Y92.830, public park as the place of occurrence of the external cause</li>\r\n	<li>Y99.8, other external cause status</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAnd with that, the staff at Fix ‘Em Up Clinic wishes you a safe and happy weekend!',

In ICD-10-CM, our choices are:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Poisoning, accidental (unintentional)</li>\r\n	<li>Poisoning, intentional self-harm</li>\r\n	<li>Poisoning, assault</li>\r\n	<li>Poisoning, undetermined</li>\r\n	<li>Adverse effect</li>\r\n	<li>Underdosing</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nFor our patient who overdosed on citric acid, the Table of Drugs directs us to T47.5X1 (poisoning by digestants, accidental [unintentional]). However, we can’t stop there. We still need to double-check our code in the Tabular List. When we do, we notice that all of the codes in the T47- series require a seventh character to identify the encounter:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>A, initial</li>\r\n	<li>D, subsequent</li>\r\n	<li>S, sequela</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIf the physician saw the patient for an initial encounter for an accidental citric acid overdose, we would report T47.5X1A.\r\n\r\nThe opposite of an overdose is an underdose, and ICD-10-CM adds a column to the Table of Drugs to represent underdosing.\r\n\r\nAn underdose may be intentional (the patient doesn’t like the side effects or can’t afford the prescription) or it can be unintentional (the patient forgot to take the medication, possibly because of dementia).\r\n\r\nThe Tabular List provides us with some additional guidelines to use for poisonings, and you’ll find them at the very beginning of the Poisoning section (T36).\r\n\r\nWhen a patient suffers an adverse event, code first the nature of the adverse effect.\r\n\r\nFor example, a patient on acebutolol develops a first degree heart block. We would report:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>I44.0, atrioventricular block, first degree</li>\r\n	<li>T44.7X5A, adverse effect of beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists, initial encounter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe also need to use additional code(s) to specify:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Manifestations of poisoning</li>\r\n	<li>Underdosing or failure in dosage during medical and surgical care (Y63.6, Y63.8-Y63.9)</li>\r\n	<li>Underdosing of medication regimen (Z91.12-, Z91.13-)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nA paranoid schizophrenic patient comes in for initial care of hallucinations. Her schizophrenia became symptomatic again because she has not been taking her prescribed dose of haloperidol. She told the physician she does not like how it makes her feel, so she reduced the dosage.\r\n\r\nFor this patient, we would report:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>F20.0, paranoid schizophrenia</li>\r\n	<li>T43.4x6A, underdosing of butyrophenone and thiothixene neuroleptics, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>Z91.128, patient\'s intentional underdosing of medication regimen for other reason</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe have one code for the condition (schizophrenia), one for the underdosing, and one for the reason for the underdosing.',

Thankfully, he avoided mishaps during food preparation, which put him well ahead of last year. Sadly, consuming the food did not go as smoothly as cooking the food.\r\n\r\nWhen Matt bit into the corn, the hot juice spurted into his eye, burning his cornea. Matt stood up so fast, he knocked over the picnic bench he was sitting on. The bench got its revenge by tripping Matt as he attempted to flee indoors to flush his burning eye with cold water. Instead, he tripped, flipped, and hit the concrete patio face first. Ouch.\r\n\r\nDr. Tom A. Toe examined Matt and documented a burn to Matt\'s eye, a broken nose, contusion of the shin (from banging into the bench), and a mild concussion with no loss of consciousness (LOC).\r\n\r\nIn order to code for Matt\'s eye injury, we need to know:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Which eye</li>\r\n	<li>Which specific part of the eye</li>\r\n	<li>Burn or corrosion</li>\r\n	<li>Encounter type</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIn his notes, Dr. Toe specified a corneal burn of the left eye and noted this was Matt\'s first visit.That gives us code T26.12XA (b<span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial,Arial,sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">urn of cornea and conjunctival sac, left eye, initial encounter).

		'body' : 'Death smiles at us all. All a man can do is smile back. (Kudos if you know I appropriated that from the movie <i>Gladiator</i>.)\r\n\r\nHistory is full of weird circumstances and odd injuries that lead to death. Let’s look at some of history’s more (in)famous deaths and see how we would code the injuries that caused death in ICD-10-CM.<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Grim-reaper-silly.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-3597\" alt=\"Grim reaper silly\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Grim-reaper-silly-300x300.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a>\r\n\r\nGoing way back to the 600s B.C., Athenian lawmaker Draco was smothered to death when happy citizens of Aegina showered him with gifts of cloaks. His cause of death was likely asphyxiation. You’ll find the codes for asphyxiation in the T71- series, which covers both mechanical suffocation and traumatic suffocation. Note that all of the codes under T71 require a seventh character to denote the encounter.\r\n\r\nT71 also includes an Excludes1 note, which means not coded here. You should never report the excluded code with the code above the Excludes1 note. Be sure to check the Excludes1 note before selecting a code from T71.\r\n\r\nIn Draco’s case, we would look for a code in the T71.1- (asphyxiation due to mechanical threat to breathing) series since the weight of the cloaks smothered him. T71.1 includes codes for suffocation by:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Smothering under pillow</li>\r\n	<li>Plastic bag</li>\r\n	<li>Bed linens</li>\r\n	<li>Another person’s body</li>\r\n	<li>In furniture</li>\r\n	<li>By hanging</li>\r\n	<li>Other causes</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nFor Draco, it’s other causes since gifts of cloaks aren’t covered. We also need to know if the asphyxiation was accidental, intentional self-harm, assault, or undetermined. I’m going with accidental, because I don’t think the citizens were trying to kill him, so our code is:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>T71.191A, asphyxiation due to mechanical threat to breathing due to other causes, accidental, initial encounter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSticking with ancient deaths (455 B.C. to be precise), we can review the tragedy of Aeschylus. According to legend, the playwright died after being hit on the head with a tortoise. Apparently a passing eagle mistook Aeschylus’ head for a rock suitable for shattering the shell of the reptile. Instead, the eagle’s falling dinner shattered Aeschylus’ skull.\r\n\r\nFor a skull fracture, we need to know the exact bone(s) fractured so we can correctly choose from these codes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S02.0, fracture of vault of skull</li>\r\n	<li>S02.1, fracture of base of skull</li>\r\n	<li>S02.2, fracture of nasal bones</li>\r\n	<li>S02.3, fracture of orbital floor</li>\r\n	<li>S02.4, fracture of malar, maxillary and zygoma bones</li>\r\n	<li>S02.5, fracture of tooth (traumatic)</li>\r\n	<li>S02.6, fracture of mandible</li>\r\n	<li>S02.8, fractures of other specified skull and facial bones</li>\r\n	<li>S02.9, fracture of unspecified skull and facial bones</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nMany of these codes also have subcategories to further specify the exact site of the fracture. All of these codes also require a seventh character to denote the encounter. For some of the codes, such as S02.0, you’ll need to add placeholder Xs, so the seventh character actually ends up in the seventh position.\r\n\r\nAeschylus probably also suffered a traumatic brain injury from the falling tortoise. ICD-10-CM category S06 (intracranial injury) includes all kinds of brain injuries, such as:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Concussion</li>\r\n	<li>Traumatic cerebral edema</li>\r\n	<li>Diffuse traumatic brain injury</li>\r\n	<li>Focal traumatic brain injury</li>\r\n	<li>Epidural hemorrhage</li>\r\n	<li>Traumatic subdural hemorrhage</li>\r\n	<li>Other specified intracranial injuries</li>\r\n	<li>Unspecified intracranial injury</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAgain, you’ll need to know the exact nature of the injury and the encounter.\r\n\r\nSadly, while ICD-10-CM does include numerous External Causes codes for being struck by a falling object, none of them specify a tortoise dropped by an eagle. Maybe next year.\r\n\r\nOur final fatality for the day comes from 162 B.C. when Eleazar Maccabeus was crushed to death at the Battle of Beth Zechariah by a war elephant that he believed to be carrying Seleucid King Antiochus V. Eleazar ran underneath the elephant and thrust a spear into its belly. Unfortunately for Eleazer, he succeeded in killing the elephant and the elephant promptly returned the favor by crushing him.\r\n\r\nEleazer likely suffered severe head injuries, traumatic asphyxia, and chest injuries such as broken ribs and bruised lungs. We’ve already looked at head injuries (falling tortoises and dying elephants create similar results) and we’ve looked at asphyxia. What about the other injuries?\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM does include codes specifically for crushing injuries, such as:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S38.1, crushing injury of abdomen, lower back, and pelvis</li>\r\n	<li>S28.0, crushed chest</li>\r\n	<li>S07, crushing injury of head</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese codes do include notes instructing you to use additional codes for all associated injuries.\r\n\r\nFor example, if a patient suffers multiple rib fractures (and I’m guessing falling elephants cause multiple rib fractures), we would add one of the following codes to our crushed chest code:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S22.41, multiple fractures of ribs, right side</li>\r\n	<li>S22.42, multiple fractures of ribs, left side</li>\r\n	<li>S22.43, multiple fractures of ribs, bilateral</li>\r\n	<li>S22.49, multiple fractures of ribs, unspecified side</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe will again need a placeholder X and a seventh character for the encounter.\r\n\r\nHad Eleazar survived being squashed by an elephant, he could have died from traumatic rhabdomyolysis. In that case, we would report T79.6 (traumatic ischemia of muscle).\r\n\r\n&nbsp;',

Let’s fast-forward to some odd Dark Ages deaths and see if we can code them. Some supposition is involved because we do not have medical records.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Grim-reaper-silly.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-3597\" alt=\"Grim reaper silly\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Grim-reaper-silly-300x300.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a>Acclaimed Chinese poet Li Bai met a watery fate in 762 when he allegedly leaned over the side of a boat he was traveling in to kiss the moon’s reflection. Alas, he leaned too far (or the moon moved), fell into the water, and drowned.\r\n\r\nTo code for this untimely demise, we need to know what happens when a person drowns. According to the World Health Organization, “Drowning is the process of experiencing respiratory impairment from submersion/immersion in liquid.”\r\n\r\nDrowning can lead to several significant medical problems, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Hypoxemia, an abnormally low level of oxygen in the blood (ICD-10-CM code R09.02).</li>\r\n	<li>Hypoxia, an insufficient supply of oxygen. That could lead to J96.01 (acute respiratory failure with hypoxia).</li>\r\n	<li>Acidosis, increased acidity in the blood and other body tissue (ICD-10-CM code E87.2)</li>\r\n	<li>Heart arrhythmia, a problem with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat. Since we don’t know the specific type of arrhythmia (if any) Li Bai suffered, we would probably report I49.9 (cardiac arrhythmia, unspecified).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nVictory in battle doesn’t always guarantee long life, as demonstrated by the saga of Sigurd the Mighty of Orkney. Sigurd apparently became embroiled in a feud with Máel Brigte Tusk (so called because he had a protruding front tooth). Sigurd’s forces defeated Máel Brigte’s troops in 892. To celebrate, Sigurd had his men cut off the heads of the enemy and attach them to their saddles. Sigurd went so far as to strap Máel Brigte’s head onto his horse\'s saddle.\r\n\r\nMáel Brigte was dead, but he wasn’t out. His protruding tooth cut Sigurd’s leg. The cut became infected and Sigurd died. (I’m sure there’s a morality tale in there somewhere.)\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM contains literally pages of codes for infection divided by the type of infection. Since Sigurd’s infection proved to be fatal, it was probably sepsis or at some point he became septic.\r\n\r\nNot surprisingly, ICD-10-CM contains a plethora of sepsis codes. They take up almost two-thirds of a page in the Alphabetic Index. It’s important to remember that sepsis is not its own entity. It is the body’s reaction to infection.\r\n\r\nIn ICD-10-CM, coders default to A41.9 (sepsis, unspecified organism) when the physician doesn’t document or can’t determine the infectious organism.\r\n\r\nIf a patient has severe sepsis (meaning at least one organ has failed or shut down), coders should report R65.20 (severe sepsis without septic shock) or R65.21 (severe sepsis with septic shock). Don’t use either of these codes alone. Always code first the underlying infection. You also need to use additional code(s) to identify specific acute organ dysfunction.\r\n\r\nCrown Prince Philip of France also met an untimely and inglorious death caused on horseback. On October 13, 1131, Phillip took to his horse to tour Paris with a group of friends. While they were traveling along the Seine, a black pig without regard for Phillip’s royal standing darted out of a dung heap and tripped Phillip’s horse. Phillip went flying over the horse’s head, broke his neck, and died the next day without regaining consciousness.\r\n\r\nIn order to code for Phillip’s cervical fracture, we need to know which cervical vertebrae he actually fractured.\r\n\r\nFracture of cervical vertebra and other parts of neck fall under category S12. Each cervical vertebra has its own series of codes, which include additional codes that further define the fracture.\r\n\r\nFor example, if Phillip suffered a hangman’s fracture, Type III traumatic spondylolisthesis of second cervical vertebra, we would code S12.14XA for the initial encounter. The seventh character in this code denotes the encounter. We also need a placeholder, since the code is only five characters long and the seventh character needs to be in the seventh spot. S12.14A is not a valid code.',

Fortunately, many of those additional codes simply specify laterality. For example, ICD-9-CM features only one code for acute swimmer’s ear (382.12). ICD-10-CM gives you four choices:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>H60.331, swimmer\'s ear, right ear</li>\r\n	<li>H60.332, swimmer\'s ear, left ear</li>\r\n	<li>H60.333, swimmer\'s ear, bilateral</li>\r\n	<li>H60.339, swimmer\'s ear, unspecified ear</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou have four times as many codes, but only one additional piece of information (laterality). Providers may (should) already be documenting laterality, so check the current documentation before you start asking physicians to add the information.\r\n\r\nICD-9-CM lumps diffuse otitis externa and otitis externa hemorrhagicia into one code: 380.10.\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM gives each one its own series. Diffuse (H60.31) and hemorrhagic (H60.32) otitis externa each have four codes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Right</li>\r\n	<li>Left</li>\r\n	<li>Bilateral</li>\r\n	<li>Unspecified</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nOther otitis externa (ICD-9-CM code 380.22) gets seven series of codes in ICD-10-CM, which each include specific codes for laterality. You’ll find:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>H60.50, unspecified acute noninfective otitis externa</li>\r\n	<li>H60.51, acute actinic otitis externa</li>\r\n	<li>H60.52, acute chemical otitis externa</li>\r\n	<li>H60.53, acute contact otitis externa</li>\r\n	<li>H60.54, acute eczematoid otitis externa</li>\r\n	<li>H60.55, acute reactive otitis externa</li>\r\n	<li>H60.59, other noninfective acute otitis externa</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nICD-10-CM does have a code for unspecified acute noninfective otitis externa, unspecified ear (H60.509). That’s probably not a code you want to use often. In some circumstances, it’s perfectly legitimate to use an unspecified code. But not being able to specify laterality might not go over so well with payers. You may want to think carefully about using H60.509 and other unspecified codes with unspecified laterality.\r\n\r\nThe codes for the ear are in generally the same order in ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM.

It’s not just a headache? It’s really a migraine? Well, I guess that explains those funny lights I saw right before the headache started.\r\n\r\nI know this will probably make my head hurt worse, but I can’t help but wonder how to code my migraine in ICD-10-CM.\r\n\r\nBoth ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM contain multiple codes for migraines. Let’s check out the list of ICD-10-CM codes.\r\n\r\nThe first choice is migraine without aura (G43.00). Well, I saw those funny lights before the migraine started, so we can rule that series of codes out.\r\n\r\nAs an aside, if you aren’t familiar with migraines and auras, you can find a lot of information on <a href=\"http://www.webmd.com/migraines-headaches/what-is-a-migraine-with-aura\">WebMD</a>.\r\n\r\nThe next codes look like the correct ones:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>G43.10, migraine with aura, not intractable</li>\r\n	<li>G43.11, migraine with aura, intractable</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWhat exactly does intractable mean though? Intractable simply means the migraine does not get better with standard treatment.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the migraine code series, ICD-10-CM gives us this note: “The following terms are to be considered equivalent to intractable: pharmacoresistant (pharmacologically resistant), treatment resistant, refractory (medically) and poorly controlled.” If we see any of those terms in the documentation, we’ll use a code for intractable migraine.\r\n\r\nI haven’t taken anything for my migraine yet, so I don’t know for sure whether it is intractable. Either way, we need an additional piece of information before we can assign a code:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>With status migrainosus</li>\r\n	<li>Without status migrainosus</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nA migraine attack that lasts for more than 72 hours is called status migrainosus. Oh, that would really be a killer. My migraine has only been visiting for a few hours, so it’s without status migrainosus.\r\n\r\nThat narrows my choices down to:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>G43.109, migraine with aura, not intractable, without status migrainosus</li>\r\n	<li>G43.119, migraine with aura, intractable, without status migrainosus</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nI can’t pick a final code until I know whether normal treatment will make the migraine go away.

In our non-scientific JustCoding poll, only 17% of respondents were completely confident their organization would be ready October 1, 2014.\r\n\r\nAlmost one-third (31%) think it could go either way and 29% are cautiously optimistic. Those numbers are sort of reassuring. More people believe they will be ready than are convinced they won’t be.\r\n\r\nThe scary number is the 10% who believe they will absolutely not be ready. It may sound like an insignificant number, but guess what? It’s great if you are ready, but if the hospital down the street  or the physician practice next door isn’t ready, that’s a big problem.\r\n\r\nAny organization that isn’t transitioned to ICD-10 can’t share data with other providers or payers. That creates a gap in information, potentially harms patient care, and slows down reimbursement.\r\n\r\nTake stock of where you are now. Determine what you need to do and develop (or revise) a timeline to get you there. Don’t wait until September 1, 2014 to complete a documentation assessment or begin coder training.\r\n\r\nWe’re all in this transition together and we will only succeed if we all reach the finish line by October 1, 2014.',

We know certain codes without having to look them up. (Anyone know the code for unspecified diabetes?) We know where to look in the record for certain information.\r\n\r\nOne reason coders are worried about the transition to ICD-10-CM is we’re losing all of those codes we know so well. Now we’ll have to look up diabetes unspecified instead of entering 250.00. In case you’re interested, the ICD-10-CM code is E11.9. Yes, we still have unspecified codes in ICD-10-CM.\r\n\r\nI had an interesting conversation with AHIMA’s Ann Barta, MSA, RHIA, CDIP, earlier this week. We were talking about how sepsis coding will change in ICD-10-CM and she made an interesting observation.\r\n\r\nAnn commented that all coders have a group of ICD-9-CM codes that they know by heart. We didn’t learn those codes overnight. I doubt anyone sat down with an ICD-9-CM manual and decided to memorize certain codes. You learn them by using them over and over again.\r\n\r\nThe same thing will happen with ICD-10-CM, Ann says. She has been working with ICD-10-CM for seven years now (she’s way ahead of the rest of us). And at this point, she already has some ICD-10-CM codes memorized.\r\n\r\nSo if you’re worried about ICD-10-CM because you’re losing your comfortable codes, don’t be. You didn’t have the ICD-9-CM codes memorized when you started coding. You learned them as you went. The same thing will happen in ICD-10-CM.\r\n\r\nOne caveat though. Don’t expect to memorize ICD-10-PCS codes. Ann by now knows the first three characters (section, body system, root operation), so she can go right to the tables. However, she still looks up the last four in part because the fourth character—body part—changes with each body section. The ICD-10-PCS codes are a little too complex to memorize completely, but if you know the first three, you can get to the correct table, and that’s the important thing for PCS.',

For the epidemiologists among us, three major plague outbreaks were recorded worldwide: the Plague of Justinian in the 6th and 7th centuries <a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Grim-reaper-silly.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-3597\" alt=\"Grim reaper silly\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Grim-reaper-silly-300x300.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a>(first known attack of bubonic plague); the Black Death (what most people think of when they hear plague); and an 18<sup>th</sup> century outbreak in China.\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM helpfully includes multiple codes for plague depending on the type.\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>A20.0, bubonic plague</li>\r\n	<li>A20.1, cellulocutaneous plague</li>\r\n	<li>A20.2, pneumonic plague</li>\r\n	<li>A20.3, plague meningitis</li>\r\n	<li>A20.7, septicemic plague</li>\r\n	<li>A20.8, other forms of plague (abortive plague, asymptomatic plague, and Pestis minor)</li>\r\n	<li>A20.9, plague, unspecified</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThey all sound unpleasant.\r\n\r\nOf course, if the plague didn’t kill you, plenty of other pathogens and infectious diseases were just waiting and they had some interesting and descriptive names.\r\n\r\nThey include the bloody flux, now more commonly called dysentery. ICD-10-CM classifies dysentery by the causative organism, so you’ll find dysentery codes all through the infectious diseases chapter. They include:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>A03.0, shigellosis due to Shigella dysenteriae</li>\r\n	<li>A03.9, shigellosis, unspecified (bacillary dysentery NOS)</li>\r\n	<li>A06.0, acute amebic dysentery</li>\r\n	<li>A07.0, balantidiasis (balantidial dysentery)</li>\r\n	<li>A07.9, protozoal intestinal disease, unspecified (protozoal dysentery)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSadly, in the Middle Ages dysentery was endemic in both the armies of the day and crowded cities. Dysentery was also an equal-opportunity disease. It killed two English kings—King John in 1216 and King Henry V in 1422.\r\n\r\nIf you manage to avoid plague and dysentery, you might fall victim to the red plague (aka smallpox). Although the World Health Organization declared smallpox eradicated, ICD-10-CM still includes a code for it—B03. You will find the following note under the code: In 1980 the 33rd World Health Assembly declared that smallpox had been eradicated. The classification is maintained for surveillance purposes.\r\n\r\nOf course, not all deaths were due to diabolical diseases. Sometimes, cleverness was its own curse. Robert Marmion, an English knight during the civil war between King Stephen and Empress Matilda, devised what he thought was an excellent battle strategy. He had his men dig pits on the battlefield to snare the enemy. Alas, Robert forgot to have the locations of the pits marked. He suffered a broken leg when his horse encountered one of the pits. His poor planning continued when he popped his head up out of the pit like a prairie dog and an enemy soldier promptly lopped it off.\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM does not include a code for decapitation, but we do have a code for traumatic amputation of part of the head—S08.89. This code does require a placeholder X and a seventh character to denote the encounter.\r\n\r\nWe can add some External Causes codes to round out the story:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>X99.2XXA, assault by sword or dagger, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>Y92.828, other wilderness area as the place of occurrence of the external cause</li>\r\n	<li>Y99.1, military activity</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nNote that we would not code Robert’s broken leg because we aren’t treating it, he’s dead.',

Lantern is here at Stich ‘Em Up Hospital to have his guts removed.\r\n\r\nDr. Carver begins by removing a section of Jack’s skull, then begins to remove Jack’s guts.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Pumpkin-scary.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-3634\" alt=\"Pumpkin scary\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Pumpkin-scary-300x238.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"238\" /></a>How would we code this procedure in ICD-10-PCS?\r\n\r\nWe know we are in the medical and surgical section, so our first character is 0. The vast majority of codes in ICD-10-PCS are in the medical and surgical section.\r\n\r\nNext, we need to know the body system. For Jack’s surgery, it’s the gastrointestinal system (the guts). That gives us a second character, D.\r\n\r\nOur next character represents the root operation. What was Dr. Carver attempting to do? In her documentation, Dr. Carver stated she removed Jack’s liver, stomach, large intestine, small intestine, appendix, and gall bladder. That makes our root operation removal, right?\r\n\r\nWrong. ICD-10-PCS defines removal as “taking out or off a device from a body part.” Dr. Carver isn’t taking out a device, she’s taking out body parts.\r\n\r\nIn order to decide which of the body part removal root operations we will use, we need to know whether she is taking out the entire body part or only part of it. Also, what method is she using? Different ICD-10-PCS root operations represent:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Pulling or stripping out or off all or a portion of a body part by the use of force (extraction)</li>\r\n	<li>Cutting out or off, without replacement, a portion of a body part (excision)</li>\r\n	<li>Cutting out or off, without replacement, all of a body part (resection)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nDr. Carver documented that she removed the complete organs, so excision is out. ICD-10-PCS does not include extraction as a possible root operation for the gastrointestinal system, so we can eliminate that one as well.\r\n\r\nThat leaves us with resection and makes the first three characters of our code 0DT.\r\n\r\nIn the 0DT table, we find a plethora of body parts, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>6, Stomach</li>\r\n	<li>7, Stomach, pylorus</li>\r\n	<li>8, Small intestine</li>\r\n	<li>9, Duodenum</li>\r\n	<li>A, Jejunum</li>\r\n	<li>B, Ileum</li>\r\n	<li>C, Ileocecal valve</li>\r\n	<li>E, Large intestine</li>\r\n	<li>F, Large intestine, right</li>\r\n	<li>G, Large intestine, left</li>\r\n	<li>H, Cecum</li>\r\n	<li>J, Appendix</li>\r\n	<li>K, Ascending colon</li>\r\n	<li>L, Transverse colon</li>\r\n	<li>M, Descending colon</li>\r\n	<li>N, Sigmoid colon</li>\r\n	<li>P, Rectum</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nPay attention to two things. First, we have separate body part values for different sections of the small and large intestines.\r\n\r\nThis becomes very significant if the physician only removes, say, the cecum. Because the cecum is considered a body part, you would use the root operation resection. If the physician is only removing part of the cecum, then you use root operation excision.\r\n\r\nIf a physician documents he or she removed a part of the large intestine, you need to know which specific part, because that could affect your root operation selection. If a physician documents removing part of the large intestine and that part turns out to be the entire transverse colon, you would code resection. Hopefully, the physician documents the specific body part or portion of a body part removed. Otherwise, you may need to query.\r\n\r\nThe other thing to notice is the gall bladder and liver are not part of the gastrointestinal system. They are in the hepatobiliary system, so we’ll need a different table in order to code those procedures.\r\n\r\nFor our gastrointestinal procedures, we have four possible approaches:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>0, Open</li>\r\n	<li>4, Percutaneous endoscopic</li>\r\n	<li>7, Via natural or artificial opening</li>\r\n	<li>8, Via natural or artificial opening endoscopic</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nDr. Carver documented opening up Jack, so our approach is open. We have no choices for devices or qualifiers, so our final coders for the gastrointestinal procedures are:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>0DT60ZZ, open resection of the stomach</li>\r\n	<li>0DT80ZZ, open resection of the small intestine</li>\r\n	<li>0DTE0ZZ, open resection of the large intestine</li>\r\n	<li>0DTJ0ZZ, open resection of the appendix</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nFor the remaining two organs, liver and gall bladder, we head to table 0FT.\r\n\r\nICD-10-PCS breaks the liver down into three possible body parts:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>0, Liver</li>\r\n	<li>1, Liver, right lobe</li>\r\n	<li>2, Liver, left lobe</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nDr. Carver removed the entire liver, so we’ll use 0.\r\n\r\nFor the liver and gall bladder, we have only two possible approaches: open and percutaneous endoscopic. We also have no device or qualifier choices other than none (Z).\r\n\r\nOur two codes are:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>0FT00ZZ, open resection of liver</li>\r\n	<li>0FT40ZZ, open resection of gall bladder</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSo now poor Jack is gutless.',

Aside from missing all of the splendid fall foliage, you could also be straining your neck muscles and causing yourself plenty of pain.\r\n\r\nSo how do you code a pain in the neck in (not from) ICD-10-CM?\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/vampire1.gif\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-2758\" alt=\"vampire\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/vampire1-240x300.gif\" width=\"240\" height=\"300\" /></a>Let’s start with the Alphabetic Index. If we look up pain, neck, we get an NEC (not elsewhere classified) code. However, if we look up strain, neck, the index directs us to S16.1. Notice that you can look up cervical or neck and end up with the same code.\r\n\r\nThis code does not include a dash indicating it requires additional codes. But when we go to the Tabular Index, we see that we need a seventh character to denote the encounter. Since S16.1 only has four characters, we need two placeholder Xs.\r\n\r\nFor a subsequent encounter for a cervical strain, we would report S16.1XXD.\r\n\r\nWhat else could be causing our neck pain? The orthopedic folks are undoubtedly saying, arthritis. ICD-10-CM includes a lot of arthritis codes. How do we narrow down our choices since we don’t have a code for arthritis, neck?\r\n\r\nThe first thing we need to know is what type of arthritis it is. Is it due to some underlying condition? Is it juvenile arthritis? Perhaps it’s rheumatoid arthritis. If it is degenerative arthritis, we need to look at the osteoarthritis codes.\r\n\r\nWell, Dr. Hack says it is degenerative arthritis of the cervical spine, so we head to the osteoarthritis codes. And we’re not going to find the code we need here. Under osteoarthritis, spine, the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index tells us to see spondylosis.\r\n\r\nSpondylosis codes are found under category M47 and include arthrosis or osteoarthritis of the spine and degeneration of facet joints.\r\n\r\nWe also find codes for:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Anterior spinal artery compression syndromes</li>\r\n	<li>Other spondylosis with myelopathy (global weakness, gait dysfunction, loss of balance, and loss of bowel and/or bladder control)</li>\r\n	<li>Other spondylosis with radiculopathy (sensory and motor disturbances, such as severe pain in the neck, shoulder, arm, back, and/or leg, accompanied by muscle weakness)</li>\r\n	<li>Other spondylosis</li>\r\n	<li>Spondylosis, unspecified</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe severe pain in located in the neck, so we would go with a code from other spondylosis with radiculopathy (M47.2).\r\n\r\nOur pain is in the neck, but we need to be even more specific than that. ICD-10-CM includes three different codes depending on the exact site of the pain:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>M47.21, other spondylosis with radiculopathy, occipito-atlanto-axial region</li>\r\n	<li>M47.22, other spondylosis with radiculopathy, cervical region</li>\r\n	<li>M47.23, other spondylosis with radiculopathy, cervicothoracic region</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWait, Dr. Hack made a mistake. It’s not really arthritis. He doesn’t know what is causing the pain. But the patient does have two small puncture wounds on the neck (S11.83XA, puncture wound without foreign body of other specified part of neck, initial encounter).\r\n\r\nHey, tonight is the hunter’s full moon.

He also reports a strange urge to howl at the moon and a severe allergy to silver. And when he smiled, I saw some really long canine teeth.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Werewolf.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-3646\" alt=\"Werewolf\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Werewolf-272x300.jpg\" width=\"272\" height=\"300\" /></a>What could be wrong with Jacob?\r\n\r\nDr. Lycan Thrope diagnoses Jacob with hypertrichosis. That’s really just a blanket term for too much hair. ICD-10-CM includes multiple possibilities for coding hypertrichosis (L68):\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>L68.0, hirsutism</li>\r\n	<li>L68.1, acquired hypertrichosis lanuginosa</li>\r\n	<li>L68.2, localized hypertrichosis</li>\r\n	<li>L68.3, polytrichia</li>\r\n	<li>L68.8, other hypertrichosis</li>\r\n	<li>L68.9, hypertrichosis, unspecified</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nA diagnosis just of hypertrichosis isn’t going to get us far. We do have an unspecified code, but at this point, we don’t know if Jacob’s insurance company will pay for unspecified ICD-10-CM codes. So we need to query Dr. Thrope.\r\n\r\nUpon further review, Dr. Thrope eliminates all of our potential specific variants of hypertrichosis and instead writes: congenital terminal hypertrichosis.\r\n\r\nBeing the coding experts we are, we noticed this note under L68:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Excludes1: congenital hypertrichosis (Q84.2)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nICD-10-CM features two types of Excludes notes so coders no longer have to guess what it means. An Excludes1 note means not coded here. The two codes are mutually exclusive. In this case, you can\'t code Q84.2 with any code from the L68 series.\r\n\r\nOff to the Q codes we go. Q84.2 represents other congenital malformations of hair, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Congenital hypertrichosis</li>\r\n	<li>Congenital malformation of hair NOS</li>\r\n	<li>Persistent lanugo</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBecause Dr. Thrope documented congenital terminal hypertrichosis, Q84.2 is our code. Don’t let the term “terminal” throw you off. Terminal is a type of hair, it doesn’t mean Jacob is about to die. Terminal hair is thick, long, and dark.\r\n\r\nNow that we’ve got the hair out of the way, we’ll move on to Jacob’s other complaints.\r\n\r\nThat urge to howl at the moon? It could be delusions that he really is a werewolf. In that case, we would code F22 (delusional disorders). On the other hand, he may just be preparing for National Howl at the Moon Day, slated for October 26. No ICD-10-CM code for that one.\r\n\r\nNow the silver allergy. We need to know a little bit more about this condition. In ICD-10-CM, under Allergy, we find a whole list of substances. But if you look at the term Allergy, you’ll see some non-essential modifiers in parentheses:  (reaction) (to). These are supplementary words that may be present or absent in the statement of a disease or procedure without affecting the code assigned.\r\n\r\nWhat Jacob really has is an allergic reaction to silver that causes contact dermatitis. That gives us L23.0 (allergic contact dermatitis due to metals).\r\n\r\nIt turns out Jacob really does have extra-long canine teeth, which Dr. Thrope diagnoses as macrodontia (K00.2). Lots of different conditions fall under K00.2 (abnormalities of size and form of teeth), so you’ll need to carefully read the list of included conditions.\r\n\r\nSome of these conditions may actually be symptoms of an underlying disease (or diseases). Delusions could be a sign of a serious mental disorder. The excessive hair could be a sign of too much testosterone (or too much Rogaine). As coders we need to only code what’s in the documentation. Since Dr. Thrope didn’t document any underlying conditions, we’ll go with the ones we have.\r\n\r\nTime to go practice my howling.',

Rudolph, RHIT, CCS, </b>and<b> Joanne Schade-Boyce, BSHD, MS, COC, ACS, PCS, </b>from Health Revenue Assurance Associates talked about the hidden impact of ICD-10. For example, the timeframe for an acute MI in ICD-10-CM goes from eight weeks to four weeks. Not only is that going to be a struggle for coders to remember, it can also affect your MS-DRG, Donna says.\r\n\r\nHave you thought about how you current coding policies and procedures will have to change under ICD-10? We’re so focused on education right now, we may not be assessing policies and procedures, Joanne says.\r\n\r\nYou’ll hear lots more from Joanne and Donna’s presentation in an upcoming issue of JustCoding.\r\n\r\nWhen are you planning to start dual coding and which method are you going to use? Are you going to code concurrently or retrospectively? How many records are you going to code in ICD-10 and how will you check the accuracy? <b>Kimberly Carr, RHIT, CCS, CDIP, </b>manager of clinical documentation for HRS, raised all of those questions during her session on justifying the cost of dual coding. One of the biggest advantages to dual coding: reducing your risk for inaccurate coding because coders will be more comfortable in ICD-10. And, oh, by the way, that will reduce your productivity loss as well.\r\n\r\nHow do you get to the Carnegie Hall of ICD-10? Practice, practice, practice. That’s Donna’s line, but it was a consistent theme across multiple presentations. The best way for coders to learn ICD-10 and get comfortable is to practice coding actual records in ICD-10. The challenge is to find the time.\r\n\r\nMore on these presentations and other ICD-10 sessions from AHIMA later.',

Dr. Shelly is reattaching a hand, so we know our root operation.\r\n\r\nBefore we can find the correct table, we need to determine the body system. ICD-10-PCS does not include a body system value for the arm or hand separately. They are rolled into the anatomical region Upper Extremity (X).\r\n\r\nNow we can get to the correct ICD-10-PCS table: 0XM. We have lots of choices for specific body parts being reattached, so we need to carefully read the operative report to make sure we choose the correct one.\r\n\r\nDr. Shelly documented reattachment of the right hand, which gives us J as a fourth character. The rest of the characters are easy. We only have one possible approach (open) and no device or qualifiers. That gives us a final code of 0XMJ0ZZ (reattachment of right hand, open approach).\r\n\r\nFrank also has several flaps of skin that need to be replaced. Frank does not have the missing skin flaps, so Dr. Shelly is going to use some skin replacements. We’re still in the Medical and Surgical section (0) and our body system is Skin and Breast (H). Now we need to determine the correct root operation. To do that, we need to skim the operative report to determine the objective of the procedure.\r\n\r\nIn the OP report, Dr. Shelly states she replaced skin on Frank’s left upper leg, abdomen, and scalp with Apligraf®. When we look at our root operation definitions, we see two root operations that could apply to skin grafts.\r\n\r\nThe first is Repair (restoring, to the extent possible, a body part to its normal anatomic structure and function). Dr. Shelly isn’t really restoring the skin, she is replacing it.\r\n\r\nOur second possible root operation looks more promising. Replacement involves putting in or on biological or synthetic material that physically takes the place and/or function of all or a portion of a body part. Apligraf is a biological material, so it qualifies for replacement, giving us our root operation.\r\n\r\nWe can now head to table 0HR. We know Dr. Shelly is replacing skin at three sites, so we will report three different codes. We do need to know one other piece of information. Is the replacement partial or full thickness?\r\n\r\nIf Dr. Shelly doesn’t document this information, we must query. (Yeah, I know, you hate sending doctors queries almost as much as they hate getting them. But without that information we can’t code the procedures.)\r\n\r\nFortunately, Dr. Shelly documents partial thickness, giving us codes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>0HRJXK4, replacement of left upper leg skin with non-autologous tissue substitute, partial thickness, external approach</li>\r\n	<li>0HR7XK4, replacement of abdomen skin with non-autologous tissue substitute, partial thickness, external approach</li>\r\n	<li>0HR0XK4, replacement of scalp skin with non-autologous tissue substitute, partial thickness, external approach</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nTwo quick notes: Our only choice for approach is external, which makes perfect sense if you think about it. Procedures performed directly on the skin or mucous membrane use an external approach.\r\n\r\nThe second thing is we have multiple locations for skin of the leg. ICD-10-PCS includes not just left and right leg, but also upper and lower designations. If your physician isn’t documenting the exact location, you may need to query. Before you do, though, make sure the physician hasn’t documented any anatomical landmarks that you can use to determine the location.\r\n\r\nDr. Shelly also finds that Frank’s right kidney is not working properly, so she is going to transplant a new kidney. It just so happens she has one on hand (Best not to ask where she got it).\r\n\r\nICD-10-PCS defines Transplantation as “putting in or all of a portion of a living body part taken from another individual or animal to physically take the place and/or function of all of a similar body part.”\r\n\r\nDr. Shelly is replacing Frank’s kidney with a live body part, so Transplantation is our root operation. The kidney is part of the urinary system, leading us to table 0TY. We know Dr. Shelly is replacing the right kidney, which gives us 0 for our body part. Our only choice for approach is open (0) and Z is our only choice for a qualifier.\r\n\r\nThe only other thing we need to know is what type of kidney Dr. Shelly is using:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>0, allogeneic</li>\r\n	<li>1, syngeneic</li>\r\n	<li>2, zooplastic</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIf you don’t know the difference, now is a good time to learn.\r\n\r\nAn allogeneic transplant comes from a non-identical donor of the same species—one person donates a kidney to another person. It can be a family member or a complete stranger.\r\n\r\nA syngeneic transplant involves an organ from an identical member of the same species (think identical twin).\r\n\r\nA zooplastic transplant involves a transplant from one species to another. Pig heart valves implanted into humans is one example.\r\n\r\nDr. Shelly documented that the donor kidney was human, but not from an identical twin, which gives us 0 for our qualifier and a complete code of 0TY00Z0 (transplantation of right kidney, allogeneic, open approach).\r\n\r\nFrank is now put back together with fully functioning body parts just in time for trick-or-treating.',

During the AHIMA Conference in Atlanta October 26-30 the topic of outpatient coders using ICD-10-PCS came up repeatedly.\r\n\r\nSome facilities now require coders to report ICD-9-CM procedure codes for outpatient services so they can compare data for inpatient and outpatient services, outcomes, etc. Some commercial payers also require ICD-9-CM procedure codes for outpatient services.\r\n\r\nThe jury is still out on what payers will do once we transition to ICD-10. But facilities should start to think about training outpatient coders on ICD-10-PCS. Outpatient coders are used to looking for information in the operative report that inpatient coders don’t need to see now. That should help outpatient coders in ICD-10-PCS.\r\n\r\nHowever, what physicians need to document for CPT code assignment is not always the same as what they need to document for ICD-10-PCS. You knew it couldn’t be easy, right?\r\n\r\nHaving everyone code in ICD-10-PCS could be a good thing. We would get standardized data on all procedures, regardless of the setting. We would also have more coders who can fill in when someone is on vacation, out sick, or leaves the organization.\r\n\r\nOn the downside, training all coders on ICD-10-PCS costs money and takes time. It will also probably decrease productivity, which could result in a slowdown in reimbursement.\r\n\r\nWeigh the pros and cons at your organization and talk to your payers.

		'body' : 'Mr. Jack O. Lantern underwent some significant surgery at Stitch ‘Em Hospital back on October 16. Dr. Carver removed Jack’s liver, stomach, large intestine, small intestine, appendix, and gall bladder. Unfortunately, Jack is suffering some complications from his surgery.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Pumpkin-scary.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-3634\" alt=\"Pumpkin scary\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Pumpkin-scary-300x238.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"238\" /></a>Jack is back in to Stitch ‘Em Up Hospital for inpatient wound care.\r\n\r\nDr. Carver first diagnoses Jack with a fungal infection of the skin due to <em>Podosphaera xanthii. </em>When we look up infection in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index, we find quite a list of potential codes. We know Jack has a skin infection, so if we go to Infection, Skin, we find an entry for “due to fungus.” We actually have two choices:<em></em>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>B36.8, other specified superficial mycoses</li>\r\n	<li>B36.9, superficial mycosis, unspecified</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSince we know the causative organism, we would use B36.8. Remember that other specified is not the same as unspecified. We know the cause, we just don’t have a code for it. Some antibiotics should clear that right up.\r\n\r\nSadly, that is not the extent of Jack’s woes. Dr. Carver also diagnoses him with gangrenous cellulitis, an infection of soft tissue that produces extensive tissue necrosis and local vascular occlusions. Basically, Jack’s rotting from the inside.\r\n\r\nIf we look up cellulitis, gangrene in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index, we are directed to Gangrene. However, gangrene does not list cellulitis as one of the sub-terms. The main code for gangrene is I96 (gangrene, not elsewhere classified). When we look that up in the Tabular List, we find gangrenous cellulitis listed under I96.\r\n\r\nDr. Carver also documents gangrene of the abdominal wall, which also maps to code I96.\r\n\r\nDr. Carver determines that Jack needs some excisional debridement to remove the gangrene so he can return to health.\r\n\r\nIn ICD-9-CM procedure coding, we would code excisional debridement using 86.22. How would we code it in ICD-10-PCS?\r\n\r\nIn order to get to the correct ICD-10-PCS table, we need to know the section, body system, and root operation. Section is easy. We know we are coding for a surgical procedure, which gives us an initial character of 0 (zero, not a capital O).\r\n\r\nLet’s skip the body system for a minute and figure out which root operation we’re going to use. When you look up debridement in the ICD-10-PCS Alphabetic Index, you find two choices:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Excisional, see Excision</li>\r\n	<li>Non-excisional, see Extraction</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe need to do a little investigating in Dr. Carver’s operative report to find out exactly what she did, so we know whether we’re coding excisional or non-excisional debridement.\r\n\r\nExcisional debridement involves removing or cutting away devitalized tissue, necrosis, or slough. It is always a surgical procedure. Physicians use a recognized sharp instrument, such as a cutting curette, laser, scissors, or scalpel, to perform the excisional debridement.\r\n\r\nDr. Carver documents removal of devitalized tissue using a scalpel, so we are coding an excisional debridement.\r\n\r\nOn to the body system. Where specifically is Jack’s gangrene? Hopefully, Dr. Carver is very specific in her documentation, otherwise we’ll need to query.\r\n\r\nWe know some of the gangrene is located in the abdominal wall. ICD-10-PCS classifies the abdominal wall as a general anatomical region, which leads us to table 0WB.\r\n\r\nAbdominal wall gives us a fourth character of F.\r\n\r\nNow we need the approach. We have three choices:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Open (0)</li>\r\n	<li>Percutaneous (3)</li>\r\n	<li>Percutaneous endoscopic (4)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBecause of the extent of Jack’s abdominal gangrene, Dr. Carver elects an open approach. We have no device choice, which makes the sixth character Z. Our final character can be either X (diagnostic) or Z (no qualifier).\r\n\r\nFor Dr. Carver’s excisional debridement of Jack’s abdominal gangrene, our code is 0WBF0ZZ.\r\n\r\nWhat about the rest of the debridements? Again, we need to know where exactly Dr. Carver is performing the debridements, as well as how deep the debridements are.\r\n\r\nICD-10-PCS guidelines state that an excisional debridement that includes skin, subcutaneous tissue, and muscle is coded to the muscle body part.\r\n\r\nDr. Carver documents the following debridements:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>13 sq cm of the left quadriceps, percutaneous</li>\r\n	<li>9 sq cm of the right flexor pollicis longus and pronator quadratus, percutaneous</li>\r\n	<li>10 sq cm of subcutaneous tissue in the right lower leg, percutaneous</li>\r\n	<li>8 sq cm of dermis on the scalp, external approach</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nFor each debridement, we need a specific code. Each one will vary based on the body system, the body part, and the approach. All of the codes will include the same section, root operation, device, and qualifier.\r\n\r\nIf you don’t know where the flexor pollicis longus and pronator quadratus muscles are, check the body part guide in the back of your ICD-10-PCS Manual (For the record, they are arm muscles).\r\n\r\nOur codes would be:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>0KBR3ZZ, excision of left upper leg muscle, percutaneous approach</li>\r\n	<li>0KB93ZZ, excision of right lower arm and wrist muscle, percutaneous approach</li>\r\n	<li>0JBN3ZZ, excision of right lower leg subcutaneous tissue and fascia, percutaneous approach</li>\r\n	<li>0HB0XZZ, excision of scalp skin, external approach</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nHopefully, Dr. Carver excised all of the dead tissue and Jack will soon be on the mend.',

Our friends at the <a href=\"http://www.hcpro.com/acdis/\">Association for Clinical Documentation Improvement Specialists </a>(ACDIS) dedicate their professional lives to improving physician documentation.\r\n\r\nMany on the HIM side are also worried about training physicians about ICD-10 and documentation. How do you get them to listen (and care)?\r\n\r\nHere are some quick pointers I picked up from various speakers at the AHIMA Convention last month in Atlanta:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Physicians really want to hear from other physicians. And it helps if that physician is in the same specialty. Neurologists aren’t interested in hearing from plastic surgeons and cardiologists don’t care what orthopedists have to say.</li>\r\n	<li>Keep the information relevant to the physician’s specialty. Don’t talk to pulmonologists about gastrointestinal procedures.</li>\r\n	<li>Tell physicians specifically what they aren’t documenting. If they are already documenting laterality, don’t mention it during discussions about documentation improvement. If you spend time telling them they need to document something that is already in their notes, they may miss when you point out what isn’t in the documentation.</li>\r\n	<li>Give them concrete examples from their documentation. This takes a little bit of work, but it could pay off big time. Take the physician’s note, open the ICD-10 manual, and physically show them what information is in the documentation and what information the coders need.</li>\r\n	<li>Remind the physicians that ICD-10 is not going to change the way they treat patients. It’s not about the practice of medicine. We know they provide great care, we just want them to document that care.</li>\r\n	<li>Ask the physician if his or her documentation would pass muster in medical school. Would you accept this note from a resident?</li>\r\n	<li>Last, but probably most important—tell them why they should care. And don’t talk about money. They don’t care. They’re still getting paid based on CPT® codes for their services. Besides, financial gain should never be the main goal of documentation improvement. However, their documentation will affect their quality scores and their profile. So it really is in their best interests to clearly document how sick the patient is, what the physician was thinking, and how the physician treated the patient.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nHave any other tips or ideas?

That doesn’t sound good.\r\n\r\nOn a clinical note, however, chlamydiosis in birds is different from the human venereal disease chlamydia. Patients who contract chlamydiosis from birds often experience fever, headache, and loss of appetite. They may also experience painful or difficult breathing.\r\n\r\nChlamydiosis in birds, such as our Big Apple party crashers, is caused by a bacterial organism, <i>Chlamydophila psittaci. </i>And it just so happens we have a specific ICD-10-CM code for it: A70 (Chlamydia psittaci infections).\r\n\r\nWe all know not to eat raw eggs and I certainly don’t want to fight a wild turkey for one (the grocery store ones come with much less hazard to my hands). Odds are, we won’t contract salmonellosis from the NYC flock.\r\n\r\nColibacillosis is caused by our old friend <em>Escherichia coli. E. coli can cause all sorts of unpleasant conditions, including:</em><em></em>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>A04.0, enteropathogenic <i>Escherichia coli i</i>nfection</li>\r\n	<li>A04.1, enterotoxigenic <i>Escherichia coli</i> infection</li>\r\n	<li>A04.2, enteroinvasive<i> Escherichia coli</i> infection</li>\r\n	<li>A04.3, enterohemorrhagic <i>Escherichia coli </i>infection</li>\r\n	<li>G00.8, meningitis due to <i>Escherichia coli </i></li>\r\n	<li>J15.5, pneumonia due to<i> Escherichia coli</i></li>\r\n	<li>P36.4, sepsis of newborn due to <i>Escherichia coli</i></li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThose all sound like awesome reasons to avoid the walking turkeys and their droppings.\r\n\r\nBut what happens when a turkey tries to cross Broadway? Well, if the bird is unlucky, it will get run over. New Yorkers stop for no fowl.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the birds are smart enough to cross en masse, they could cause some serious traffic disruptions and possibly some traffic accidents. We’ll leave the specific injuries (contusions, lacerations, broken bones, etc.) out of the equation for the moment and look at the External Causes codes associated with traffic accidents.\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM includes multiple code possibilities for transport accidents in sections V00-V99. The introductory note for the section states:\r\n\r\n<i>This section is structured in 12 groups. Those relating to land transport accidents (V01-V89) reflect the victim\'s mode of transport and are subdivided to identify the victim\'s \'counterpart\' or the type of event. The vehicle of which the injured person is an occupant is identified in the first two characters since it is seen as the most important factor to identify for prevention purposes. A transport accident is one in which the vehicle involved must be moving or running or in use for transport purposes at the time of the accident.</i>\r\n\r\nIf the turkeys on the Great White Way caused an accident, we would likely head to V40 (car occupant injured in collision with pedestrian or animal). Our choices include:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>V40.0, car driver injured in collision with pedestrian or animal in nontraffic accident</li>\r\n	<li>V40.1, car passenger injured in collision with pedestrian or animal in nontraffic accident</li>\r\n	<li>V40.2, person on outside of car injured in collision with pedestrian or animal in nontraffic accident</li>\r\n	<li>V40.3, unspecified car occupant injured in collision with pedestrian or animal in nontraffic accident</li>\r\n	<li>V40.4, person boarding or alighting a car injured in collision with pedestrian or animal</li>\r\n	<li>V40.5, car driver injured in collision with pedestrian or animal in traffic accident</li>\r\n	<li>V40.6, car passenger injured in collision with pedestrian or animal in traffic accident</li>\r\n	<li>V40.7, person on outside of car injured in collision with pedestrian or animal in traffic accident</li>\r\n	<li>V40.9, unspecified car occupant injured in collision with pedestrian or animal in traffic accident</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAll of these codes require a seventh character to indicate the encounter type, so you’ll also need two placeholder Xs so the seventh character ends up in the seventh spot.\r\n\r\nSo if you’re flocking to New York for the holidays, watch out for those wild birds.',

Coding managers should know how well their coders know anatomy and physiology and medical terminology. Ideally, coders should also have started training on the code sets. Some organizations are done training and are onto the practice stage, while others are just compiling the results of their coder assessments.\r\n\r\nDual coding has been a hot topic in HIM circles for at least a year now. People are trying to figure how and when to start dual coding, which method to use, and how many records to code. Some people think that dual coding or coder training and practice is all they need to get their coders ready for ICD-10.\r\n\r\nNot quite. It’s not enough to be able to pick a code in ICD-10. You have to assign the correct code. How do you know if you are assigning the correct code? That’s where things can get tricky.\r\n\r\nIf you are coding actual records from your facility, you don’t have an answer key to look at to know you came up with the right answer. If you are the only one at your facility coding a particular record in ICD-10, you don’t even have anyone to ask.\r\n\r\n<b>Rachel Chebeleu, MBA, RHIA,</b> and her colleagues at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania (HOP) came up with a solution. A group of superusers at HOP took a group of actual hospital records and each person coded each record in ICD-10. Then they compared notes to see whether they all arrived at the same codes. If they did, great. If they didn’t, they discussed the case and why each person came up with a specific code.\r\n\r\nConsider creating a coding roundtable at your facility to make sure you not only practice coding in ICD-10, but you end up with the correct codes.\r\n\r\nOne horseman down, keep an eye out for Documentation.',

		'body' : 'You may remember that the American Medical Association (AMA) has been pushing for an end to ICD-10 since 2012. During its recent House of Delegates meeting, the AMA reinforced its position that ICD-10 implementation should be delayed by two years. It initially put forth that resolution in June.<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Cadusius.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-3159\" alt=\"Cadusius\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Cadusius-300x300.jpg\" width=\"197\" height=\"197\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe AMA already helped force CMS to delay implementation of ICD-10 from October 1, 2013, to October 1, 2014. That may not have been a great thing for physicians, according to <b>Paul Weygandt, MD, JD, MPH, MBA, CCS</b>, vice president of physician services for J.A. Thomas and Associates in Atlanta.\r\n\r\n“The worst thing for physicians was that the AMA delayed ICD-10 by one year,” he told AHIMA Convention attendees. That gave physicians the idea that the AMA will stop ICD-10 implementation again.\r\n\r\nHow do you get physicians on board for ICD-10 when the AMA is not? Remind them that ICD-10 doesn’t change the way they practice medicine. They will still treat patients the same way they do now. We’re just asking them to document a little more.\r\n\r\nPhysicians are likely documenting much of the necessary information already, such as laterality, because it’s good patient care. The physician wants to know where an injury occurred so when the patient comes back for a follow up, he or she is checking the correct area.\r\n\r\nICD-10 is also written in more clinical terms and less coder speak, which means docs will need to learn less than coders. For example, many pulmonologists already describe asthma as:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Mild intermittent</li>\r\n	<li>Mild persistent</li>\r\n	<li>Moderate persistent</li>\r\n	<li>Severe persistent</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nICD-10-CM now uses those terms.\r\n\r\nFor myocardial infarctions, physicians have been documenting STEMI and non-STEMI for years, Weygandt says. In ICD-10-CM, coders will be able to report it that way.\r\n\r\nDon’t tell physicians what they need to document. Tell them what they aren’t documenting. Give them a (figurative) pat on the head for the things they are doing correctly. And ask them if they would accept their documentation if it came from a resident.\r\n\r\n“Good documentation for ICD-10 is what we should be teaching residents because it’s good clinical care,” Weygandt says.\r\n\r\nICD-10 is coming, whether the AMA wants it to or not. Work with your physicians now so you are all ready for the change.',

		'body' : 'Farmer Brown came in today to see Dr. Gobbler for some injuries sustained when he tried to prepare his Thanksgiving main course. It seems Farmer Brown’s turkey wasn’t interested in joining him as dinner.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Turkey.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-3431\" alt=\"Turkey\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Turkey-300x274.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"274\" /></a>Farmer Brown first attempted to wring the turkey’s neck. After a considerable chase around the yard (and multiple trips and falls by Farmer Brown), he eventually captured the reluctant bird. Unfortunately for Farmer Brown, the turkey pecked his hands until he let go.\r\n\r\nThat gives us our first code for this encounter: puncture wound of the hand. The question is, which hand? In this case, it’s both hands, so we would report two codes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S61.431A, puncture wound without foreign body of right hand, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S61.432A, puncture wound without foreign body of left hand, initial encounter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIf the turkey had left part of his beak behind, we would have used the code for puncture wound with foreign body (S61.441A or S61.442A) for the appropriate hand. Notice also that we need a seventh character to denote the encounter.\r\n\r\nWe can also add some external causes codes to round out our story:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>W61.43XA, pecked by turkey, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>Y92.73, farm field as the place of occurrence of the external cause</li>\r\n	<li>Y93.K9, activity, other involving animal care</li>\r\n	<li>Y99.8, other external cause status</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nFarmer Brown’s attempts don’t stop with interrupted wringing. Next, he tried an axe to cut off the turkey’s head. A chase again ensued, with the turkey neatly tripping Farmer Brown, so he dropped the axe. Unfortunately for Farmer Brown, he dropped the axe onto his foot and crushed two toes.\r\n\r\nWe need to know which toes and which foot was involved. We scan Dr. Gobbler’s notes and find that Farmer Brown crushed two lesser toes on his left foot. That gives us code S97.122A (crushing injury of left lesser toe[s], initial encounter). Regardless of how many lesser toes (one to four) Farmer Brown crushed, we only report one code.\r\n\r\nIf Farmer Brown had crushed his great toe and one lesser toe, we would need two codes. The great toe has its own code (S97.112A, crushing injury of left great toe, initial encounter).\r\n\r\nFarmer Brown’s third and (thankfully) final attempt to bag the bird involved a really big kettle of boiling water. The turkey decided to enlist the aid of a few friendly cows (who never liked Farmer Brown anyway) to tip over the cauldron and drench Farmer Brown.\r\n\r\nFortunately, he suffered only minor first-degree burns to his right leg. We do need some additional specificity in order to code this injury, namely the location of the burns. The following sites on the leg can be coded specifically:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Thigh</li>\r\n	<li>Knee</li>\r\n	<li>Lower leg</li>\r\n	<li>Multiple sites</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nDr. Gobbler documents burns to the right lower leg, so we would code T24.131A (burn of first degree of right lower leg, initial encounter).\r\n\r\nWe also spot the note under code T24.1 directing us to report additional external cause codes to identify the source, place, and intent of the burn (X00-X19, X75-X77,X96-X98, Y92), so we also report:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>X12.XXXA, contact with other hot fluids (boiling water), initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>X98.2XXA, assault by hot fluids, initial encounter (We could make a case that the turkey was only defending himself when he coerced the cows into tipping over the cauldron or that it was an accident.)</li>\r\n	<li>Y92.73, farm field as the place of occurrence of the external cause</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nFollowing his latest setback, Farmer Brown has decided to let the turkey live and take his wife out for dinner instead. Let someone else deal with uncooperative poultry.',

She apparently elbowed another shopper out of the way to grab the last sweater on the rack. She is also experiencing difficulty when trying to bend her elbow and is wheezing when breathing.\r\n\r\nDr. Donner performs an initial evaluation and then sends Stephanie off for x-rays of her elbow. Dr. Prancer’s x-ray report states that Stephanie suffered a posterior subluxation of the left ulnohumeral joint with no broken bones.\r\n\r\nDr. Donner notes the findings in her notes and also notes that Stephanie has a history of asthma. Dr. Donner documents that Stephanie’s wheezing is due to mild, intermittent asthma without complications.\r\n\r\nThat gives us the following codes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S53.122A, posterior subluxation of left ulnohumeral joint, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>J45.20, mild intermittent asthma, uncomplicated</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nOur next patient, Jane, comes in with a bleeding hand. Apparently Jane snagged the last iPad and another shopper wanted it enough to bite Jane’s hand. Ouch.\r\n\r\nDr. Donner cleans and dresses the wound and documents an open bite of the right hand. She also notes that the bite was a deliberate assault which took place in a shopping mall. That gives us codes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S61.451A, open bite of right hand</li>\r\n	<li>Y04.1XXA, assault by human bite, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>Y92.59, other trade areas as the place of occurrence of the external cause (the mall)</li>\r\n	<li>Y99.8, other external cause status</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIf Jane sustained simply a superficial bite, we would have reported code S60.571A (ather superficial bite of hand of right hand, initial encounter).\r\n\r\nOur final patient of the day came in for some non-shopping, but still holiday-related, setbacks. Ralph, a 23-year-old, apparently enjoyed Thanksgiving dinner at Mom’s house so much he had seconds, and thirds, and fourths. He now is suffering from a severe stomach ache and feels bloated. He complains of nausea but denies vomiting. He also complains of chest pain and has no history of heart problems.\r\n\r\nDr. Donner orders an EKG to rule out a heart problem as the cause of the chest pain. Dr. Donner rules out an ulcer and cancer as causes of Ralph’s pain. She also rules out a hernia. Dr. Dasher’s EKG report shows no signs of heart problems.\r\n\r\nDr. Donner diagnoses Ralph with functional dyspepsia and advises him to moderate his food intake in the future. That gives us code K30 (functional dyspepsia).\r\n\r\nI think it’s time to grab some leftovers and start my Cyber Monday shopping. Happy Thanksgiving!',

		'body' : 'Everybody likes a shortcut. We want to get things done faster, arrive home sooner, finish tasks more quickly. Generally shortcuts are good. Unless you’re talking about physician documentation. Then shortcuts are very bad.\r\n\r\nOne of the advantages to ICD-10 coding is the increased specificity of the codes. However, without complete, accurate documentation, more specific codes do us no good. We don’t need physicians to write a dissertation, but we do need them to give us some specific information.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Four-horsemen.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-3685\" alt=\"Four horsemen\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Four-horsemen-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>We know physicians don’t document well now. We know we often default to unspecified codes. How many times do you report 250.00 for a diabetic patient or 715.90 for osteoarthritis (that’s not specified as generalized or localized, site unspecified)? Neither one of those ICD-9-CM codes tells us (or the physician) much about the patient’s condition.\r\n\r\nSo how do we defeat the Second Horseman of the ICD-10 Apocalypse? First, look at the current state of your physician documentation. You can’t fix it if you don’t know it’s broken (or in this case deficient). What’s missing in ICD-9? What will be missing in ICD-10?\r\n\r\nNext, talk to your physicians. Show them their documentation, then show them the codes. Show them where their actual documentation is lacking. Don’t use generic examples. Use their actual documentation. Some of your physicians will be better than others.\r\n\r\nMost physicians are not lining up to learn how to code in ICD-10 and that’s okay. We don’t want to teach them how to code (feel free to tell them that). We just want them to provide a clear picture of the patient’s illness or injury, their thought processes, and what they did to make the patient better. Really, they should already be doing that.\r\n\r\nRemind them that good documentation does affect patient care. If we didn’t need clinical specificity, physicians could just say, the patient is sick. How sick is the patient? What specifically is wrong with the patient? And how can you treat the patient if you don’t know what’s wrong?\r\n\r\nIf physicians document accurately and completely, they will better represent the patient’s severity of illness and risk of mortality (and they can show that their patients are actually sicker than everyone else’s). They can better track the patient’s disease process. Is the patient better or worse? Has the disease progressed or is the treatment working?\r\n\r\nIt will also make for better communication between physicians treating the patient. If Dr. Jones documents that Jane suffers from monoplegia after a stroke, Dr. Smith doesn’t really know which limb is affected. If Jane comes in and is unable to move her right arm, Dr. Smith may think that’s a late effect from the stroke.\r\n\r\nHowever, if Dr. Jones documents that Jane suffers from monoplegia of a lower limb following nontraumatic intracerebral hemorrhage affecting the right dominant side (I69.141), Dr. Smith knows immediately that a paralyzed right arm is a new problem.\r\n\r\nYou can also point out that better documentation leads to fewer queries from clinical documentation specialists and coders. That frees the physicians to spend more time treating patients, which is why most of them went to medical school in the first place.',

Let’s see if we can diagnose the Grinch’s health woes.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Bah-humbug.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-3707\" alt=\"Bah humbug\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Bah-humbug-300x200.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a>First, he is as cuddly as a cactus. What does that mean? He’s covered in spines? A better explanation is he suffers from eczema, which causes redness, skin edema (swelling), itching and dryness, crusting, flaking, blistering, cracking, oozing, or bleeding. Great, we have a condition. Now we need a code. And ICD-10-CM has a lot of codes for eczema to specify the type, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>B00.0, eczema herpeticum</li>\r\n	<li>H01.13, eczematous dermatitis of eyelid (subcategories identify which eye and which lid)</li>\r\n	<li>H60.54, acute eczematoid otitis externa (again, we need to specify right, left, bilateral)</li>\r\n	<li>L20, atopic dermatitis (with an associated list of subcategories)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWhat else is wrong with the Grinch? One friend calls him “a bad banana with a greasy black peel.” A black peel (skin) could be necrosis and we need to know the exact location in order to code for it. If Mr. Grinch suffers from skin necrosis only, we would report I96 (gangrene, not elsewhere classified).\r\n\r\nOr maybe he has necrotizing fasciitis (M72.6), in which case we need to use an additional code (B95.-, B96.-) to identify causative organism.\r\n\r\nFurther reports claim Mr. Grinch’s head is full of spiders. Literally? Let’s hope not. I don’t think medical science could do much for him. Perhaps Mr. Grinch is suffering from a psychological condition that makes his behavior erratic.\r\n\r\nHe could be suffering from borderline personality disorder (F60.3, note this code excludes antisocial personality disorder [F60.2]).\r\n\r\nOr maybe he’s bipolar. If that’s the case, we need a lot more specific information. For example, is he in a manic or depressive phase? Is he displaying psychotic symptoms? Is he in full remission or partial remission?\r\n\r\nThe Grinch also suffers from termites in his smile, better known as dental caries. Well, we still need to know what kind of dental caries:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>K02.3, arrested dental caries</li>\r\n	<li>K02.5-, dental caries on pit and fissure surface</li>\r\n	<li>K02.6-, dental caries on smooth surface</li>\r\n	<li>K02.7, dental root caries</li>\r\n	<li>K02.9, dental caries, unspecified</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAlthough several of these categories includes more specific subcategories, sadly, termite-induced is not one of our choices.\r\n\r\nThe Grinch also suffers from seasickness, T75.3- (motion sickness). Two things to note here. One, we need a seventh character to identify the episode of care. To make sure it shows up in the seventh position, we also need two placeholder Xs. We also need to report an additional external cause code to identify vehicle or type of motion (Y92.81-, Y93.5-).\r\n\r\nMr. Grinch is further described as “a crooked jerky jockey.” A-ha! He suffers from scoliosis! Oh dear, we need some more specific information to choose between our scoliosis codes (isn’t that always the case?):\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>M41.2-, other idiopathic scoliosis (with subcategories specifying the spinal region affected)</li>\r\n	<li>M41.3-, thoracogenic scoliosis</li>\r\n	<li>M41.4-, neuromuscular scoliosis (this is scoliosis secondary to cerebral palsy, Friedreich\'s ataxia, poliomyelitis and other neuromuscular disorders and we need to code also the underlying condition)</li>\r\n	<li>M41.5-, other secondary scoliosis</li>\r\n	<li>M41.8-, other forms of scoliosis</li>\r\n	<li>M41.9, scoliosis, unspecified</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nMr. Grinch reported consuming a three-decker sauerkraut and toadstool sandwich with arsenic sauce (yuck!). Perhaps he was poisoned by the arsenic. In order to code for the poisoning, we need to know whether it was:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Accidental, T57.0X1</li>\r\n	<li>Intentional self-harm, T57.0X2 (not likely given the patient)</li>\r\n	<li>Assault, T57.0X3 (much more likely)</li>\r\n	<li>Undetermined, T57.0X4 (always a popular fallback)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nDon’t forget to include the seventh character for the encounter. Hopefully, Dr. Seuss can successfully sift through the Grinch’s conditions and prescribe the correct treatment to get him back in the holiday spirit!',

So the code for an initial encounter for chilblains is T69.1XXA (Note that it doesn’t matter if you capitalize the Xs or any other letters in the code).\r\n\r\nCoding for frostbite is a little more complicated. We need to know where, specifically, the frostbite is located. In Suzie’s case, she was zipping along in an open sleigh, so her frostbite is on her face. Her mother bundled up every other part of Suzie.\r\n\r\nWe also need to know if the frostbite is superficial or if tissue necrosis has occurred.\r\n\r\nFortunately, for Suzie, her frostbite is superficial and limited to her right ear, nose, and forehead. This is her first visit, so we would code:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>T33.011A, superficial frostbite of right ear, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>T33.02XA, superficial frostbite of nose, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>T33.09XA, superficial frostbite of other part of head, initial encounter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nMake sure you don’t forget the placeholders on the nose and other part of the head codes.\r\n\r\nNo more sleigh rides. We’ll stay home by the fire, roasting chestnuts. Great plan until the chestnuts explode (I guess we over-roasted them) and the fire spreads out of control.\r\n\r\nThe resulting injuries include burns to the thumb and first three fingers of the left hand (from grabbing the hot chestnuts), bruises to various body parts from chestnut projectiles, and one unlucky spectator whose glass shattered after a direct hit from a chestnut, causing lacerations to the hand.\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM very helpfully divides burns to the fingers into:<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Fireplace.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-3717\" alt=\"Fireplace\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Fireplace.jpg\" width=\"288\" height=\"230\" /></a>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Thumb</li>\r\n	<li>Single finger excluding thumb</li>\r\n	<li>Multiple fingers including the thumb</li>\r\n	<li>Multiple fingers excluding the thumb</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIn this case, we would report:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>T23.142A, burn of first degree of multiple left fingers (nail), including thumb, initial encounter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe also need to use additional external cause code to identify the source, place, and intent of the burn (X00-X19, X75-X77, X96-X98, Y92):\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>X10.1XXA, contact with hot food, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>Y92.018, other place in single-family (private) house as the place of occurrence of the external cause</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nX75-X77 denote intentional self-harm, while X96-98 specify assault. Although we were assaulted by hot chestnuts, I don’t think we can say the chestnuts meant to do it.\r\n\r\nFor our contusions, we would report a separate code for each body part bruised, such as:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S00.83XA, contusion of other part of head (forehead)</li>\r\n	<li>S40.022A, contusion of left upper arm, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S70.11XA, contusion of right thigh</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nFinally, our unfortunate guest with the broken glass. We need to know which hand was injured, whether any of the glass remained in the wound, and the encounter. Remember that if the finger(s) or wrist is lacerated as well, we would report additional codes.\r\n\r\nFor a laceration of the right hand without a foreign body in the wound, initial encounter, we would report S61.411A. If it’s the left hand, we would report S61.412A. We do have a code for unspecified hand, but the physician really should be documenting laterality.\r\n\r\nNow that we’ve ushered out the injured, it’s time to clean up this mess so we can plan our next holiday gathering.',

Participants are suffering from:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Party-reindeer.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-3722\" alt=\"Party reindeer\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Party-reindeer-300x300.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a>Functional dyspepsia (K30)</li>\r\n	<li>Nausea (R11.0)</li>\r\n	<li>Projectile vomiting (R11.12)</li>\r\n	<li>Nausea with vomiting, unspecified (R11.2)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nNote that we have different codes for nausea alone, vomiting alone, and nausea with vomiting. One specific code in the R11 series (R11.11) indicates vomiting without nausea. Make sure you read the medical record completely to identify the correct code.\r\n\r\nAlso remember that if the nausea and/or vomiting are inherently part of another condition, we don’t code it separately.\r\n\r\n<i>When the snow lay round about, deep and crisp and even</i>\r\n\r\nSnowball fight! Ouch, that hurt! You packed ice in there. Now I’m going to have a cut on my cheekbone and a black eye. Hey, wait a minute, that wasn’t ice. It was a rock. Great, now I’m going to have a scar.\r\n\r\nWe need to know which eye and the encounter to code this unexpected ambush by ice. For a black right eye, initial encounter, we would report S00.11XA.\r\n\r\nFor the laceration, we again need laterality and encounter, but we also need to know if any of the foreign body remained in the wound. Fortunately, no rock fragments remained, so we would report S01.411A (laceration without foreign body of right cheek and temporomandibular area, initial encounter).\r\n\r\n<i>Brightly shone the moon that night, though the frost was cruel</i>\r\n\r\nOne unlucky guest is now suffering from snow blindness. Apparently the moon was a little too bright. When we look up blindness, snow in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index, we are directed to photokeratitis. Again, we need to know laterality—right, left, bilateral, unspecified—but no encounter. Our guest apparently is on Santa’s naughty list because she has bilateral snow blindness (H16.133).\r\n\r\nThat frost was pretty cruel, as it turns out. Two people ended up with severe frostbite after taking a turn around King W’s garden and sadly are going to lose some toes. In order to code frostbite we need to know:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Superficial or with tissue necrosis</li>\r\n	<li>Specific location, including laterality</li>\r\n	<li>Encounter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nFor an initial encounter for frostbite with tissue necrosis of the left toes, we would report T34.832A. We would use the same code for one toe or five toes or any number in between. If the frostbite and necrosis continues to the foot, we would add code T34.822A. If our unlucky explorer also ended up with superficial frostbite of the left ankle, we would report T33.812A.\r\n\r\n<i>When a poor man came in sight gathering winter fuel</i>\r\n\r\nTurns out he’s not a poor man, he’s suffering from dementia and wandered away from home. What caused his dementia? Is it age related or disease related? For example, is he 96 years old and his mental faculties have eroded or is he 55 and suffering from early onset Alzheimer’s?\r\n\r\nIf we don’t know the cause of his dementia (maybe he can’t tell us and we’re waiting for lab tests), we can code F03.91 (unspecified dementia with behavioral disturbance). We would also need an additional code for wandering, Z91.83 (wandering in diseases classified elsewhere). We would report the same Z code if the patient suffered from Alzheimer’s or autism.\r\n\r\nWell, this party has been a bit of a downer. Time to move on to a more festive gathering.',

		'body' : 'Today’s rehearsal for the children’s Christmas play at Anytown Middle School was unforgettable for all of the wrong reasons. Just look at the waiting room at the Fix ‘Em Up Clinic.\r\n\r\nFirst in to see Dr. Frost is Mary. While making her grand entrance into the stable, she tripped over the manger and took a header into the first row of seats, which thankfully was on the same level as the stage. As a result of her fall, Mary now needs two front teeth for Christmas.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Christmas-pageant.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-3726\" alt=\"Christmas pageant\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Christmas-pageant-300x154.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"154\" /></a>Mary also gets ICD-10-CM code S02.5- (fracture of tooth [traumatic]).\r\n\r\nWe can add some additional external cause codes (formerly E codes) to round out Mary’s story:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>W01.190A, fall on same level from slipping, tripping and stumbling with subsequent striking against furniture, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>Y92.212, middle school as the place of occurrence of the external cause</li>\r\n	<li>Y93.01, activity, walking, marching and hiking</li>\r\n	<li>Y99.8, other external cause status</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nICD-10-CM includes quite a few codes for falling, slipping, tripping, and stumbling. Mary tripped over a manger and hit her mouth on a chair, hence W01.190A. If she had fallen from a raised stage, we would use a different code. Also, if she had tripped over her own two feet, as children (and some adults) do, we would have looked elsewhere for our code. As a reminder, you do need a seventh character for the fall code.\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM does not have an activity code for acting, probably because the acting itself isn’t what causes the injury. In Mary’s case, she was walking and tripped, so we used Y93.01.\r\n\r\nTwo angels are waiting to see Dr. Frost as well. They engaged in a battle over wings in the wings and both will have some scars to show for it. Gabriel suffered a laceration to his left hand (apparently the wings weren’t well constructed and ripped apart), while Raphael broke his finger.\r\n\r\nWhat information do we need to code for these injuries?\r\n\r\nLet’s start with Gabriel. For a laceration, we need to know:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Laterality</li>\r\n	<li>Specific part of the hand (or fingers)</li>\r\n	<li>Encounter</li>\r\n	<li>Foreign body in the wound</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nDr. Frost documents an initial encounter for a 2 cm laceration of the left palm with no foreign body. That gives us code S61.412A (laceration without foreign body of left hand, initial encounter). If Gabriel has cut his fingers as well, we would report additional codes for those injuries.\r\n\r\nOn to our second angel. Dr. Frost documents an open, displaced fracture of the right index finger, but we need some more information.\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Which phalanx did Raphael fracture?</li>\r\n	<li>Is this an initial or subsequent encounter?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSince we don’t see this information in Dr. Frost’s notes, we send a query. And because we are such helpful coders, we make it a multiple choice query so all he needs to do is circle the phalanx involved and initial or subsequent encounter.\r\n\r\nBased on Dr. Frost’s response to our query, we can assign S62.620B (displaced fracture of medial phalanx of right index finger, initial encounter for open fracture).\r\n\r\nBecause Raphael suffered an open fracture, we have different seventh character options than we would for a closed fracture. You need to go all the way back to the beginning of series S62- to find the appropriate choices. Make sure you go back and look at the options.\r\n\r\nOur final play participant, Joseph, made the mistake of trying to pet one of the sheep. Alas, the sheep didn’t appreciate the attention and bit Joseph’s arm hard enough to draw blood.\r\n\r\nDr. Frost documents an initial encounter for an open bite to the right forearm, which gives us code S51.851A (open bite of right forearm).\r\n\r\nWe can also add:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>W55.31A, bitten by other hoof stock, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>Y92.212, middle school as the place of occurrence of the external cause</li>\r\n	<li>Y99.8, other external cause status</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe don’t have an activity code for petting a sheep, alas. Maybe next year.\r\n\r\nLet’s hope tonight’s performance goes smoother than the rehearsal!',

		'body' : 'Christmas decorating can be a drag, especially when you get tangled in the string of lights and they literally drag you off the roof. Just ask poor Clark.\r\n\r\nFirst, he tripped over a root in the forest while scouting for the perfect Christmas tree. Luckily for him, the ground was snow covered and he only suffered a sprained ankle. Dr. Dasher documents a sprain of the talofibular ligament of the left ankle.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Guy-with-Christmas-lights.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-3734\" alt=\"Guy with Christmas lights\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Guy-with-Christmas-lights-300x237.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"237\" /></a>When we look up sprain, ankle, in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index, we learn that the talofibular ligament does not have its own code. It gets lumped in with the internal collateral ligament under “specified ligament NEC.”\r\n\r\nSo for Clark’s initial visit, we would report S93.492A (sprain of other ligament of left ankle). When Clark comes back for follow up care, we will report almost the exact same code. They only difference will be the seventh character. For a subsequent visit, it will change from A to D. If Clark suffers a sequela from his sprain, the seventh character changes to S.\r\n\r\nClark’s next project involved nailing together some reindeer for his front yard. Sadly, Clark is not the handiest of men. Instead of nailing together the deer, he hammered a nail through his hand. Back to Fix ‘Em Up Clinic he goes with the nail still in his hand.\r\n\r\nDr. Prancer documents an initial encounter for a puncture wound to the left hand with an embedded foreign object. That gives us code S61.442A (puncture wound with foreign body of left hand). Again, only the seventh character will change if Clark comes in for subsequent treatment or for treatment of a sequela.\r\n\r\nClark then decided to decorate the roof of his house. Probably not a great plan with a sprained ankle and a bandaged hand, but his wife Ellen insisted. And here’s where the lights decided to be difficult.\r\n\r\nClark failed to pay proper attention while wrapping the lights around the chimney and managed to wrap them around his ankle. The bad ankle, of course.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the majority of the string of lights went sliding off the roof. Clark, literally caught, went sliding after them. This time he wasn’t so lucky and broke his right femur and right radius.\r\n\r\nWe know the laterality for the breaks, but we also need to know:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Open or closed</li>\r\n	<li>Displaced or non-displaced</li>\r\n	<li>Specific location of the fracture</li>\r\n	<li>Encounter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIn reviewing Dr. Donner’s notes, we learn that Clark suffered a displaced midcervical closed fracture to the femur and a Colles’ fracture to the right radius.\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S72.031A, displaced midcervical fracture of right femur, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S52.531A, Colles\' fracture of right radius, initial encounter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nFor the Colles’ fracture, we don’t need to know whether it is displaced or open. If the physician documents a Colles’ fracture we have three choices: right, left, and unspecified, with the appropriate seventh character.\r\n\r\nClark is planning to pay Ralphie, a neighborhood kid, to take down the decorations. Wise plan, Clark!',

Today, he’s seeing some others who are not in the holiday spirit.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Mad-penguin.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-3730\" alt=\"Mad penguin\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Mad-penguin-250x300.jpg\" width=\"250\" height=\"300\" /></a>First is Mr. Scrooge, who complains he is being harassed by three ghosts. Dr. Seuss documents hallucinations, but we could use some additional information. Which type of hallucination does Mr. Scrooge experience? It could be:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>R44.0, auditory hallucinations</li>\r\n	<li>R44.1, visual hallucinations</li>\r\n	<li>R44.2, other hallucinations</li>\r\n	<li>R44.3, hallucinations, unspecified</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAre the hallucinations a symptom of another disease? In that case, we would code the disease or condition causing the hallucinations and not the hallucinations themselves.\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Alcoholic hallucinations (F1.5)</li>\r\n	<li>Hallucinations in drug psychosis (F11-F19 with .5)</li>\r\n	<li>Hallucinations in mood disorders with psychotic symptoms (F30.2, F31.5, F32.3, F33.3)</li>\r\n	<li>Hallucinations in schizophrenia, schizotypal, and delusional disorders (F20-F29)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nDr. Seuss believes the hallucinations are caused by a mental disorder, so he calls in Dr. H. Shrinker for a consult. After examining Mr. Scrooge, Dr. Shrinker diagnoses paranoid schizophrenia (F20.0). With the right medication, Mr. Scrooge will be ready for roast goose on Christmas day.\r\n\r\nAmy comes in complaining of lightheadedness, extreme fatigue, tinnitus, and chest discomfort. After performing a tilt test, Dr. Seuss diagnoses Amy with “Grinch syndrome”—her heart is literally too small.\r\n\r\nThe correct name of the condition, which we need to know in order to look it up in the ICD-10-CM Manual, is postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome. Even with the clinical name, we still can’t find it in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index. That means we would report I49.8 (other specified cardiac arrhythmias).\r\n\r\nThis is NOT an unspecified code. It’s an OTHER specified code, also known as not elsewhere classified. We know the condition, we just don’t have a code for it.\r\n\r\nFinally, we have Cindy Lou Who, who is no more than 2 and apparently still doesn’t sleep through the night. Her mother, Sandy Sue Who, is worried enough to bring her into the clinic. Dr. Seuss eliminates insomnia caused by drugs or mental disorders, so we’re looking for a code in the F51- series (sleep disorders not due to a substance or known physiological condition).\r\n\r\nDr. Seuss learns that Cindy Lou is so excited about Santa’s impending arrival that she literally can’t sleep. He diagnoses adjustment insomnia (F51.02) and tells Sandy Sue it should resolve after Christmas.\r\n\r\nAnd with that, the Fix ‘Em Up Clinic is closed for the holiday.

Dr. Frost reviews her past medical history and learns that Rebecca broke her ankle in the past. Based on current images of Rebecca’s ankle, Dr. Frost diagnoses traumatic arthropathy of the right foot.\r\n\r\nThat gives us ICD-10-CM code M12.571 (traumatic arthropathy, right ankle and foot). Note that ICD-10-CM includes laterality for all of the traumatic artropathy codes. The codes are also divided by site, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Shoulder (M12.51)</li>\r\n	<li>Elbow (M12.52)</li>\r\n	<li>Wrist (M12.53)</li>\r\n	<li>Hand (M12.54)</li>\r\n	<li>Hip (M12.55)</li>\r\n	<li>Knee (M12.56)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nCodes in the M12 series (traumatic arthropathy) should not be used for:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>current injury</li>\r\n	<li>post-traumatic osteoarthritis of first carpometacarpal joint (M18.2-M18.3)</li>\r\n	<li>post-traumatic osteoarthritis of hip (M16.4-M16.5)</li>\r\n	<li>post-traumatic osteoarthritis of knee (M17.2-M17.3)</li>\r\n	<li>post-traumatic osteoarthritis NOS (M19.1-)</li>\r\n	<li>post-traumatic osteoarthritis of other single joints (M19.1-)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nOur next patient, Jeff, was walking home from his New Year’s Eve party after consuming several adult beverages. Thankfully, he only lives two doors down from the party, so it was a short walk. Unfortunately, he missed seeing the ice on the sidewalk, slipped, and fell on his posterior. He thought he just bruised his butt and the pain would go away quickly. It didn’t, so he’s in to see Dr. Frost.\r\n\r\nAfter hearing Jeff’s description of his slip and fall, as well as his symptoms, Dr. Frost orders an x-ray. Sure enough, Jeff fractured his coccyx in the fall.\r\n\r\nCoding a fractured coccyx in ICD-10-CM is pretty easy. We only have one code. However, it is only a four-digit code and it requires a seventh character to identify the encounter.\r\n\r\nSince this is the first visit, we would report code S32.2XXA (fracture of coccyx, initial encounter).\r\n\r\nWe can add some external causes codes to tell a better story of Jeff’s injury to the insurance company:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>W00.0XXA, fall on same level due to ice and snow, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>Y92.480, sidewalk as the place of occurrence of the external cause</li>\r\n	<li>Y93.01, activity, walking, marching, and hiking</li>\r\n	<li>Y99.8, other external cause status</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nJean, our final patient of the day, decided to take up jogging to shed those extra pounds she added during the holiday season. Her route took her past several dogs who thought her running was part of a new game. The pack decided to run along with her and around her and eventually between her feet. That marked the end of Jean’s run as she tripped over a dog and ended up with multiple minor injuries.\r\n\r\nDr. Frost documents lacerated palms, bruised knee, bruised shoulder, sprained wrist, and strained quadriceps. Luckily, none of the dogs bite Jean. They just smothered her with doggie kisses after she hit the pavement.\r\n\r\nFor the lacerations, we need to know whether any foreign bodies remain in the wounds. We also need to know laterality and encounter.\r\n\r\nFor the bruises, again we need laterality and encounter. For the sprain and strain, we need to know which ligament or joint is involved. In ICD-10-CM, sprains and strains are reported using different codes, so you need to carefully read the physician’s documentation.\r\n\r\nDr. Frost documents an initial visit for laceration with stone fragments on Jean’s right palm and multiple lacerations without foreign bodies to the left palm. Dr. Frost also documents a left carpal sprain and a right quadriceps strain.\r\n\r\nWhen we look up laceration, palm, in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index, we are directed to laceration, hand. Keep in mind that lacerations of the finger(s) are reported using different codes. So if a patient suffers lacerations to the hand and fingers, we would report multiple codes. The exact number of codes would depend on the number of fingers involved.\r\n\r\nUnder strain, muscle in the Alphabetic Index, we find a note directing us to see injury, muscle, by site, strain.\r\n\r\nThat gives us the following codes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S61.421A, laceration with foreign body of right hand, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S61.412A, laceration without foreign body of left hand, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S63.512A, sprain of carpal joint of left wrist, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S76.111A, strain of right quadriceps muscle, fascia and tendon, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>W01.0XXA, fall on same level from slipping, tripping, and stumbling without subsequent striking against object, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>Y92.480, sidewalk as the place of occurrence of the external cause</li>\r\n	<li>Y93.02, activity, running</li>\r\n	<li>Y99.8, other external cause status</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nICD-10-CM includes three codes for contact with a dog (all of which require a seventh character to denote the encounter):\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>W54.0-, bitten by dog</li>\r\n	<li>W54.1-, struck by dog (knocked over by dog)</li>\r\n	<li>W54.8-, other contact with dog</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIn Jean’s case, she tripped over the dog, which is why I chose W01.0XXA. That code specifies tripping over an animal. If one of the dogs had bumped into Jean, we would use W54.1XXA for the initial encounter.',

Dr. Richards performed the biopsy and based on the results, decided to perform a partial mastectomy.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Tips.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-3600\" alt=\"Tips\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Tips-300x300.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a>Can you code both the biopsy and the mastectomy? In ICD-10-PCS, the answer is yes.\r\n\r\nAccording to guideline B3.4b:\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><i>If a diagnostic Excision, Extraction, or Drainage procedure (biopsy) is followed by a more definitive procedure, such as Destruction, Excision or Resection at the same procedure site, both the biopsy and the more definitive treatment are coded.</i></p>\r\nLet’s start by looking at how to code the biopsy. When you look up biopsy in the ICD-10-PCS Alphabetic Index, you are directed to root operations drainage and excision with a diagnostic qualifier. The qualifier diagnostic is used only for biopsies.\r\n\r\nThe type of biopsy will determine the root operation. If the physician is removing fluids or gases, use root operation drainage. If the physician is removing a portion of a body part, the root operation is excision. In Ann’s case, Dr. Richards is performing an excision. She is taking out a small piece of a mass to confirm the diagnosis. That gives us table 0HB.\r\n\r\nNext, we need to know which breast Dr. Richards is taking the biopsy from in order to determine the  body part (character 4). We have six possible choices:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>T, breast, right</li>\r\n	<li>U, breast, left</li>\r\n	<li>V, breast, bilateral</li>\r\n	<li>W, nipple, right</li>\r\n	<li>X, nipple, left</li>\r\n	<li>Y, supernumerary breast</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe also need to know the approach. For most of the body parts in table 0HB, we only have one approach: external. For a breast biopsy, we have these five:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>0, open</li>\r\n	<li>3, percutaneous</li>\r\n	<li>7, via natural or artificial opening</li>\r\n	<li>8, via natural or artificial opening endoscopic</li>\r\n	<li>X, external</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nMost physicians should already be documenting the approach, but they may not being calling it via natural or artificial opening or percutaneous. As a result, you need to understand how ICD-10-PCS defines each approach and what words your physicians commonly use.\r\n\r\nIf Dr. Richards performed a needle biopsy of the right breast, we would report 0HBT3ZX (excision of right breast, percutaneous approach, diagnostic).\r\n\r\nWe would also code Ann’s partial mastectomy. We would again use the root operation excision because Dr. Richards is removing part of Ann’s breast. If Dr. Richards performed a total mastectomy, we would use the root operation resection.\r\n\r\nAgain we need to know which breast and the approach. We already know Dr. Richards is operating on the right breast. If she uses an open approach, the correct code would be 0HBT0ZZ (excision of right breast, open approach).\r\n\r\nMake sure you read the important sections of the operative report closely so you can assign the correct root operation, body part, and approach.',

More specifically, the anticipated upcoming decline in coder productivity.\r\n\r\nYou’ve probably heard the horror stories about the 50% decline in coder productivity that hit Canada after ICD-10 implementation. Will that happen here?\r\n\r\nIt’s hard to say. I’ve seen estimates ranging from a 20% decline in productivity to a 75% decline. Right now, we’re all just guessing based on other countries’ experiences implementing ICD-10-CM. Not ICD-10 overall, just the diagnosis codes. The US is the only country that will be using ICD-10-PCS to report procedures. We’re also the only country that uses ICD-10 codes for reimbursement (the looming fourth horseman).\r\n\r\nWhy will productivity decline? As simple as it sounds, coders won’t be as familiar with ICD-10 codes. You know the codes for conditions and procedures you report regularly. Coders who work in nephrology know to report a calculus of the kidney (kidney stone) with ICD-9-CM code 592.0 and calculus of the ureter with 592.1.\r\n\r\nIn ICD-10-CM, those codes become N20.0 (kidney) and N20.1 (ureter). ICD-10-CM also has a code for calculus of the kidney with calculus of the ureter (N20.2). So instead of reporting two codes, they only need one.\r\n\r\nRight now, coders can key in codes using the number pad on the side of the keyboard. That makes it pretty easy to type in numbers and go. They won’t be able to do that in ICD-10-CM because all of the codes are alphanumeric. So that will take longer.\r\n\r\nAnd then we have the dreaded documentation shortcomings. ICD-10-CM requires more specificity, which means coders need better documentation. If you don’t have the specificity you need, you have to query. And wait for the physician to answer the query before you can code.\r\n\r\nThe more time you spend on non-coding tasks, the more your productivity declines. And physician productivity will decline as well because they will need to spend more time answering queries if their documentation isn’t up to par.\r\n\r\nThe good news is that other than the look of the codes and some additional specificity, coding in ICD-10-CM is very similar to coding in ICD-9-CM. After a while, you’re going to know the codes you use all of the time and your productivity will increase. Maybe not to pre-ICD-10-CM levels, but close.\r\n\r\nThe wild card for productivity is ICD-10-PCS. We can’t learn from other countries’ implementation problems because no one else uses ICD-10-PCS. It’s also a vastly different coding system from ICD-9-CM procedure codes.\r\n\r\nThe ICD-9-CM procedure codes are very vague and general. They even include unspecified codes. ICD-10-PCS is very specific. It also eliminates unspecified codes and eponyms. You will need to brush up on you knowledge of clinical procedures in order to successfully code in ICD-10-PCS. If you don’t know what the physician does in a Billroth II, now is a good time to learn.\r\n\r\nChoose the wrong root operation and you get the wrong code and probably the wrong MS-DRG. Which means you get the wrong payment.\r\n\r\nICD-10-PCS codes require seven characters every time—no placeholders like ICD-10-CM and no vague codes like ICD-9-CM procedure codes.\r\n\r\nYou’ll need to know the intent of the procedure (root operation), the approach, the (very) specific body part, and whether it was a diagnostic procedure.\r\n\r\nMost of this information is in the operative report, but you might have to search for it. The physician may document insufflating the abdomen or inserting a scope into an orifice. That will tell you the approach.\r\n\r\nOf course digging out these details takes time, which in turn reduces productivity. If you can, start coding in ICD-10 now. Practice, after all, makes perfect (and reduces productivity declines).',

So of course people tried it at home. The results weren’t good, as the Fix ‘Em Up Clinic waiting room shows.\r\n\r\nCam thought he could impress his friends by making boiling water freeze and misjudged the wind. He generated plenty of oohs and aahs as they drove him to the clinic for treatment of his burns.\r\n\r\nWhat do we need to know to code Cam’s calamity? First, we need to distinguish between burns (caused by a heat source) and corrosion (caused by chemicals). That’s pretty easy. Boiling water is a heat source not a chemical, so we are in fact dealing with burns.\r\n\r\nNext, where specifically did he suffer the burns? ICD-10-CM includes a plethora of potential sites. Some of them are very specific.\r\n\r\nFor example, if Cam suffered burns to the head, we could code for any and all of these specific areas:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Cheek</li>\r\n	<li>Chin</li>\r\n	<li>Ear</li>\r\n	<li>Eye(s)only</li>\r\n	<li>Forehead</li>\r\n	<li>Lip</li>\r\n	<li>Neck</li>\r\n	<li>Nose</li>\r\n	<li>Scalp</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nEach area is further divided into degrees:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>First degree (erythema)</li>\r\n	<li>Second degree (blistering)</li>\r\n	<li>Third degree (full-thickness involvement)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIt’s a good idea to review the ICD-10-CM guidelines for burns as well. If the patient suffered multiple burns in the same local site (three-character category level, T20-T28), but of different degrees, report the code for the subcategory identifying the highest degree recorded in the diagnosis.\r\n\r\nFor example, if Cam suffered first- and second-degree burns to his right forearm, we would only report the ICD-10-CM code for the second-degree burn (T22.211A, burn of second degree of right forearm, initial encounter).\r\n\r\nHowever, if he suffered burns at different sites, say the left forearm and left upper arm, we would report separate codes for each burn, because they are different sites, even if they are the same degree:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>T22.112A, burn of first degree of left forearm, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>T22.132A, burn of first degree of left upper arm, initial encounter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nICD-10-CM also includes codes for the total extent of the body involved: T31 for burns and T32 for corrosions.\r\n\r\nUse these codes when the site of the burn is not specified or when additional data is needed. Use category T31 as additional coding when needed to provide data for evaluating burn mortality, such as that needed by burn units. You should also use category T31 as an additional code for reporting purposes when a third-degree burn involves 20% or more of the body surface.\r\n\r\nYou’re already familiar with these codes from ICD-9-CM, they just look different. The ICD-10-CM codes still follow the “rule of nines” to estimate body surface involved:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Head and neck 9%</li>\r\n	<li>Each arm 9%</li>\r\n	<li>Each leg 18%</li>\r\n	<li>Anterior trunk 18%</li>\r\n	<li>Posterior trunk 18%</li>\r\n	<li>Genitalia 1%</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou’ll notice that the codes in T31 and T32 list an overall percentage of body area burned and specify an additional percentage of third-degree burns. For a patient who suffered burns totaling 35% of his body surface, you would report one of the following codes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>T31.30, burns involving 30-39% of body surface with 0% to 9% third-degree burns</li>\r\n	<li>T31.31, burns involving 30-39% of body surface with 10-19% third-degree burns</li>\r\n	<li>T31.32, burns involving 30-39% of body surface with 20-29% third-degree burns</li>\r\n	<li>T31.33, burns involving 30-39% of body surface with 30-39% third-degree burns</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe’re not done yet. For all burns and corrosion codes, we also need to report external cause codes to  identify the source, place, and intent of the burn (X00-X19, X75-X77, X96-X98, Y92).\r\n\r\nFor Cam, we would report:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>X12.XXXA, contact with other hot fluids, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>Y92.017, garden or yard in single-family (private) house as the place of occurrence of the external cause</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe would not report a code from X75-X77 because he wasn’t trying to hurt himself.\r\n\r\nWe also would not report any codes from X96-X98 because no one was assaulting him.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAnd remember, don’t try this at home.',

		'body' : 'What can we revise today at Stitch ‘Em Up Hospital?\r\n\r\nFirst, we need to know what falls under root operation revision in ICD-10-PCS. Is it a procedure where the physician alters a body part, such as a revision rhinoplasty? Or maybe it involves the physician redoing a hip replacement. How about revising the pouch for a pacemaker?\r\n\r\nIn ICD-10-PCS, a revision is confined to correcting a malfunctioning or displaced device. So nose jobs need not apply for this root operation. (They fall under alteration, in case you’re wondering.).\r\n\r\nRemoving and replacing a hip replacement also does not qualify as a revision. The ICD-10-PCS Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting tell us to code the complete or partial redo of a procedure to the root operation performed rather than revision.\r\n\r\nYou also wouldn’t code the revising of a pacemaker pouch using revision. However, if the physician is going in and readjusting the placement of the pacemaker leads, that does fall under root operation revision.\r\n\r\nRevision can include correcting a malfunctioning or displaced device by taking out or putting in components of the device such as a screw.\r\n\r\nRevision is one of the ICD-10-PCS root operations that always requires a device character. So you will never see Z as your sixth character. If you code a Z in sixth position, you’ve done something wrong. Most likely, that Z is supposed to be the seventh character (no qualifier) and somehow ended up in sixth position instead.\r\n\r\nDon’t be fooled by the physician documentation. Just because the doctor calls it a revision doesn’t mean ICD-10-PCS classifies it as one. Look at what the physician actually did and use the objective of the procedure to select your root operation.\r\n\r\nSo let’s look at a couple of cases and see what we should code.\r\n\r\nDr. Gagnon removed and replaced a screw in a fracture plate located in the patient’s left tibia using an open approach. Dr. Gagnon performed the procedure because the device caused the screw to work loose.\r\n\r\nThis procedure falls under the objective of revision, so our code is 0QWH04Z (revision of internal fixation device in left tibia, open approach).\r\n\r\nDr. Giannotti revised a hip replacement because the patient suffered repetitive dislocation of a hip replacement. Dr. Giannotti decided to replace the entire prosthesis using a different device in hopes of a better outcome for the patient.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Tips.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-3600\" alt=\"Tips\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Tips-300x300.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a>We need to really look at the documentation in this case. If Dr. Giannotti is simply recementing part of the hip replacement, we would use root operation revision.\r\n\r\nIn this case, he is removing the entire prosthesis (ball and socket) and inserting a new device. In essence he’s performing a second hip replacement procedure. We would not code the hip replacement revision using the root operation revision. Instead, we would use root operation replacement.\r\n\r\nOur final example involves Dr. Andrews repositioning a Swan-Ganz catheter in the superior vena cava. Because the objective of the procedure is to correct a displaced device, we would use root operation revision. Our code for this procedure is 02WYX2Z (revision of monitoring device in great vessel, external approach).\r\n\r\nIf you don’t know the objective of the procedures your physicians currently perform, make friends with the docs or your clinical documentation improvement specialists and have them walk you through the procedure. (You can also use that time to educate them on what you need in the documentation.)\r\n\r\nMore of a visual learner? Ask if you can observe a procedure or Google it and find a video. Start now so when October 1 rolls around, you’ll have these root operations down pat.',

Instead, we’ll need to know:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/blood-drop.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright  wp-image-3008\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/blood-drop-224x300.jpg\" alt=\"blood drop\" width=\"193\" height=\"258\" /></a>Type of diabetes (I or II or secondary)</li>\r\n	<li>Cause of the disease (drug or chemical induced, due to underlying condition)</li>\r\n	<li>Body system chronic complications (e.g., kidney or neurological complications)</li>\r\n	<li>Other specific complications (e.g., foot ulcer)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe ICD-10-CM diabetes codes are combination codes. In ICD-9-CM, the diabetes codes include complications in the code descriptions. For example, 250.11 denotes type 1 diabetes with ketoacidosis. In ICD-10-CM, we also need to know whether the patient is in a coma so we can choose between:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>E10.10, type 1 diabetes mellitus with ketoacidosis without coma</li>\r\n	<li>E10.11, type 1 diabetes mellitus with ketoacidosis with coma</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSativa is a type 1 diabetic who has an implanted insulin pump. She is in today for a regular checkup. Dr. Needle notes no complications in her documentation. That gives us a nice easy code: E10.9 (type 1 diabetes mellitus without complications).\r\n\r\nYou’ll notice the code itself specifies type 1 diabetes. Unlike ICD-9-CM, type 1 and type 2 diabetes have their own code categories in ICD-10-CM. <!--more-->We would use E11.9 for a type 2 diabetic with no complications. E11.9 also serves as our default diabetes code, replacing 250.00.\r\n\r\nOur second diabetic patient, Helen, is not doing as well. Helen is a type 2 diabetic who has had several toes amputated because of her diabetes and currently suffers from a foot ulcer caused by her diabetes.\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM diabetes codes include detailed information about the specific complication caused by the patient’s diabetes. In Helen’s case, we would report E11.621 (type 2 diabetes mellitus with foot ulcer).\r\n\r\nWe also need to report an additional code to identify the site of the ulcer (L97.4-, L97.5-). Don’t worry about forgetting that detail. The “use additional code” note appears directly under E11.621.\r\n\r\nL97.4- and L97.5- both denote chronic non-pressure ulcers. Use L97.4- for ulcers on the heel and midfoot. For the rest of the foot, use L97.5-. Both categories include laterality, so we need to know which foot is affected.\r\n\r\nIn addition to knowing where on the foot the ulcer is, we also need to know the ulcer’s severity. L97.4- and L97.5- classify ulcers as:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Limited to breakdown of skin</li>\r\n	<li>With fat layer exposed</li>\r\n	<li>With necrosis of muscle</li>\r\n	<li>With necrosis of bone</li>\r\n	<li>With unspecified severity</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nDr. Needle documents a chronic diabetic ulcer of the right heel with the fat layer exposed, so we would report L97.412 (non-pressure chronic ulcer of right heel and midfoot with fat layer exposed).\r\n\r\nWe also need to report Helen’s long-term insulin use. In ICD-9-CM, we use V58.67. In ICD-10-CM, we’ll use Z79.4.\r\n\r\nOur final diabetic for the day is Jim, who suffers from Cushing’s syndrome as well as diabetes. Dr. Needle documents that his Cushing’s syndrome caused his diabetes. Jim’s diabetes also caused stage 2 chronic kidney disease.\r\n\r\nWe see a lot of cause and effect and underlying conditions in Jim’s case. Fortunately, ICD-10-CM provides us with instructional notes on what to code and what order to report the codes. If we look up diabetes due to an underlying condition, a note under code category E08 tells us to code first the underlying condition.\r\n\r\nThat means our first code is for Jim’s Cushing’s syndrome. In order to code that, we need to know the cause of the Cushing’s. Our choices include:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>E24.0, pituitary-dependent Cushing\'s disease</li>\r\n	<li>E24.1, Nelson\'s syndrome</li>\r\n	<li>E24.2, drug-induced Cushing\'s syndrome</li>\r\n	<li>E24.3, ectopic ACTH syndrome</li>\r\n	<li>E24.4, alcohol-induced pseudo-Cushing\'s syndrome</li>\r\n	<li>E24.8, other Cushing\'s syndrome</li>\r\n	<li>E24.9, Cushing\'s syndrome, unspecified</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nOnce we have that squared away, we would code Jim’s diabetes using E08.22 (diabetes mellitus due to underlying condition with diabetic chronic kidney disease).\r\n\r\nE08.22 also tells us we need a code for the stage of the chronic kidney disease. Since we know Jim’s chronic kidney disease is stage 2, we would add code N18.2 (chronic kidney disease, stage 2 [mild]).\r\n\r\nDiabetes coding in ICD-10-CM will take some getting used to, but at least we won’t have to query for controlled or uncontrolled any more.',

Really, really cold. And unlike polar bears and snow leopards, I am not a cold weather animal.\r\n\r\nSo to offset the cold this morning (and motivate myself to crawl out from under the warm covers), I decided to make some hot tea. I don’t own a tea kettle to boil water. The microwave is much faster.\r\n\r\nI nuked my water in a Pyrex glass measuring cup until it boiled (boiling water makes better tea). I took the water out of the microwave—and promptly dropped the measuring cup. In case you didn’t know, Pyrex will shatter if it hits the floor at just the right angle and in the process send that nice boiling water all over the person who dropped it.\r\n\r\nSo now I am sporting some nice first-degree burns on my lower legs. They’re not bad enough to go to the doctor, but we can code them.\r\n\r\nI suffered first-degree burns of multiple sites on both the right and left leg (I was planning on a really big cup of tea). ICD-10-CM includes codes for first-degree burns of the:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Thigh</li>\r\n	<li>Knee</li>\r\n	<li>Lower leg</li>\r\n	<li>Foot</li>\r\n	<li>Ankle</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nOf course, ICD-10-CM also includes laterality and an unspecified choice. Don’t report unspecified laterality. The physician should tell you which side. If not, query.\r\n\r\nIn my case, it’s bilateral, so we’ll need codes for the left lower leg and the right lower leg. Also note that I have burns on multiple sites. ICD-10-CM has a code for that. Well, numerous codes actually.\r\n\r\nFor this accident, we would report:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>T24.191A, burn of first degree of multiple sites of right lower limb, except ankle and foot, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>T24.192A, burn of first degree of multiple sites of left lower limb, except ankle and foot, initial encounter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe also need to use additional external cause code to identify the source, place and intent of the burn (X00-X19, X75-X77, X96-X98, Y92). This note shows up at the beginning of each category of burn codes. Just like in ICD-9-CM, you need to look for these notes when you code.\r\n\r\nI was burned by boiling water, which gives us X12.XXXA (contact with other hot fluids, initial encounter). Don’t forget your placeholders so the seventh character ends up in the seventh position.\r\n\r\nWe don’t need a code from X75-X77 because I was not trying to burn myself. I was just trying to make tea.\r\n\r\nWe also don’t need a code from X96-X98 because no one assaulted me.\r\n\r\nThe incident occurred in the kitchen, so we would add Y92.010 (kitchen of single-family [private] house as the place of occurrence of the external cause).\r\n\r\nThat alone would be a bad enough start to the morning, but I seem to be a perpetual victim of Murphy’s Law. While cleaning up the hot water and broken glass on the kitchen floor, I stepped on a small sliver of glass. And it embedded itself in my foot. What fun.\r\n\r\nSo now we have another injury to code—laceration of the foot. We need to know which foot (left) and whether a foreign body remained in the wound (sadly, yes).\r\n\r\nThat gives us S91.322A (laceration with foreign body, left foot). Again, we have an option for unspecified foot, but don’t use it. Sometimes unspecified codes are the best available to report the encounter. That doesn’t apply to laterality. On the bright side, most physicians are probably already documenting laterality.\r\n\r\nIf the injury was to my ankle or toes we would have assigned different codes.\r\n\r\nSo the kitchen is cleaned up, I slapped a Band-Aid on my foot (after removing the glass, of course), and put burn cream on my legs. Now I am going back to bed. Wake me when it’s Wednesday.',

You can burn a lot of calories (depending on how much snow you’re shoveling and how much effort you’re putting into it).\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/shutterstock_51409663.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-3774\" alt=\"shutterstock_51409663\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/shutterstock_51409663-198x300.jpg\" width=\"198\" height=\"300\" /></a>However, shoveling snow can also be hazardous to your health. You could pull a muscle in your back or develop frostbite on your exposed nose.\r\n\r\nOr like Cliff, you could suffer a myocardial infarction.\r\n\r\nCliff presents to the Acme ED with chest pain and shortness of breath. Dr. Hart performs an EKG and other lab tests and diagnosis Cliff with a myocardial infarction (MI).\r\n\r\nIn ICD-10-CM, we have separate codes for STEMI and non-STEMI MIs. A STEMI is due to a sudden occlusion of a coronary artery and is usually treated with thrombolytic therapy.\r\n\r\nAn NSTEMI is generally due to unstable plaque with an accumulation of platelets and treated with anticoagulants and platelet inhibitors.\r\n\r\nIf Cliff suffered an acute non-STEMI MI, our only code choice is I21.4 (non-ST elevation [NSTEMI] myocardial infarction).\r\n\r\nIf Cliff suffered an acute STEMI MI, we need to know the specific area involved. ICD-10-CM first breaks the areas down to:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Anterior wall (I21.0-)</li>\r\n	<li>Inferior wall (I21.1-)</li>\r\n	<li>Other site (I21.2-)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nEach subcategory is further broken down into specific arteries. For example, if Cliff suffered an acute STEMI of the anterior wall, we would choose between these codes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>I21.01, ST elevation (STEMI) myocardial infarction involving left main coronary artery</li>\r\n	<li>I21.02, ST elevation (STEMI) myocardial infarction involving left anterior descending coronary artery</li>\r\n	<li>I21.09, ST elevation (STEMI) myocardial infarction involving other coronary artery of anterior wall</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou’ll need a solid foundation in cardiac anatomy if you’re coding MIs.\r\n\r\nSo far we’ve been looking at acute MIs. Here’s where things will get a little tricky. In ICD-9-CM, an MI is considered to be acute when stated as such or when the patient has been symptomatic for a stated duration of eight weeks or less. In ICD-10-CM, that timeframe shrinks to four weeks.\r\n\r\nHow long has Cliff experienced symptoms? And is this his first MI or a subsequent MI?\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM uses initial and subsequent differently than ICD-9-CM does. In ICD-9-CM, initial and subsequent used in the code description refer to the episode of care. In ICD-10-CM, initial refers to the patient’s first MI and subsequent refers to additional MIs the patient suffers during the acute phase.\r\n\r\nIf Cliff suffered an acute STEMI three weeks ago and suffered another STEMI today, we would report a code from I21.- for the initial STEMI and assign a code from category I22.- for the subsequent MI.\r\n\r\nBefore assigning a code from category I22, we need to confirm that the patient suffered two MIs within four weeks.\r\n\r\nSubsequent MI codes don’t drill down to the vessel level like the initial codes do, so we have fewer choices:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>I22.0, subsequent ST elevation (STEMI) myocardial infarction of anterior wall</li>\r\n	<li>I22.1, subsequent ST elevation (STEMI) myocardial infarction of inferior wall</li>\r\n	<li>I22.2, subsequent non-ST elevation (NSTEMI) myocardial infarction</li>\r\n	<li>I22.8, subsequent ST elevation (STEMI) myocardial infarction of other sites</li>\r\n	<li>I22.9, subsequent ST elevation (STEMI) myocardial infarction of unspecified site</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBoth codes must be assigned and sequencing can vary on the circumstances of the admission, but remember per the <i>Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting</i> that I22 cannot be used alone.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;',

		'body' : 'It turns out that Punxsutawney Phil seeing his shadow, and thereby forecasting six more weeks of winter, wasn’t the most painful part of Groundhog Day.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/groundhog.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-3283\" alt=\"groundhog\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/groundhog-300x157.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"157\" /></a>Phil picked a bad moment to suffer from stage fright and enochlophobia (fear of crowds).\r\n\r\nPhil decided his didn’t want to make a prediction and attempted to flee the scene. He clawed his handler, who promptly dropped Phil to the platform in front of a collected assortment of national media.\r\n\r\nCaught in the glare of the spotlights, Phil froze, suffering temporary paralysis. As soon as he spotted his handler coming to collect him, he regained his motor skills and headed into the woods.\r\n\r\nDuring the ensuing chase, Bill tripped over some tree roots and went flying through the air with the greatest of ease, until he hit a tree. That left him with a concussion and a broken nose.\r\n\r\nAnother searcher, Tom, stepped in a cleverly disguised hole and twisted his ankle. Phil can create some quick booby traps on the fly, it seems.\r\n\r\nFinally, after an exhausting groundhog hunt, the mob was able to recapture Phil. Phil didn’t go down without a fight, however, biting several of his would-be wranglers.\r\n\r\nSo how would we code these Groundhog Day wounds? Let’s start with Phil (after all, he started the whole thing).\r\n\r\nWe would report Phil’s panic attack with code F41.0 (panic disorder [episodic paroxysmal anxiety] without agoraphobia). Enochlophobia is a social phobia, which leads us to F40.11 (social phobia, generalized).\r\n\r\nPhil’s handler escaped with some minor lacerations to his hands. In order to code his injuries, we need to know which hand. If both are involved, we would report a separate code for the right hand (S61.411-) and the left hand (S61.412-). We would also add additional codes for any fingers or wrists injured.\r\n\r\nIn order to code Bill’s concussion, we need to know if he suffered any loss of consciousness (LOC). ICD-10-CM includes 10 codes to specify the length of the LOC, from none to death. Pretty wide time range. ICD-10-CM also offers a code for LOC of unspecified duration.\r\n\r\nIf Bill suffered only a five-minute LOC, we would report S06.0X1A (concussion with loss of consciousness of 30 minutes or less, initial encounter). Note that a concussion with other intracranial injuries is classified in category S06-. Report the code for the specified intracranial injury instead of a concussion code.\r\n\r\nBill also broke his nose. I’m going out on a limb to say it’s a traumatic fracture, which leads us to S02.2- (fracture of nasal bones). Don’t stop there. S02.2 is not a valid ICD-10-CM code. You also need a seventh character to indicate the encounter and whether the fracture is open or closed.\r\n\r\nBill suffered a closed fracture and this is his initial encounter, which gives us seventh character A. In order to make sure A shows up in the seventh spot in the code, we need to add a pair of X placeholders, giving us S02.2XXA.\r\n\r\nWe can also add some External Causes codes to better explain what happened to Bill:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>W22.09XA, striking against other stationary object, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>Y92.821, forest as the place of occurrence of the external cause</li>\r\n	<li>Y93.02, activity, running (chasing an escaped groundhog is not an option unfortunately)</li>\r\n	<li>Y99.8, other external cause status</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWhat is the exact nature of Tom’s ankle injury? Is it a fracture? A dislocation? Or merely a sprain? Which ankle did he injure?\r\n\r\nIf Tom dislocated his left ankle, we would report S93.05XA (dislocation of left ankle joint, initial encounter). If he only sprained his left ankle, we would need to know which ligament(s) he injured. ICD-10-CM includes codes for:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Calcaneofibular</li>\r\n	<li>Deltoid</li>\r\n	<li>Tibiofibular</li>\r\n	<li>Other</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIn case the physician isn’t sure which ligament is involved, we have the option for unspecified ligament.\r\n\r\nWe could report the same External Causes codes for Tom, since he was running after the fleeing rodent.\r\n\r\nOur final group of wounded hunters suffered  open bite injuries. We need to know where the bites are in order to select the correct codes. ICD-10-CM divides codes by the area of injury, not by the type of injury. So an open bite to the right hand is reported with S61.451-, which is in the same series as the earlier lacerations of the hand.\r\n\r\nIf Phil took a chunk out of a pursuer’s left leg, we would report S80.872- (other superficial bite, left lower leg).\r\n\r\nWe would report almost the same External Causes codes, except we would report W53.81 (bitten by other rodent) instead of Y93.02\r\n\r\nPhil is now safely behind bars in a little, tiny groundhog jail while we enjoy six more weeks of winter.',

If your <a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/2013/11/four-horsemen-of-the-icd-10-apocalypse-accuracy/\">Accuracy</a> is poor, you are over- or undercoding, which leads to incorrect reimbursement. Forget a code and you lose money. Report the wrong code and the auditors may come knocking for the money back.\r\n\r\nOf course, you can’t be accurate if <a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/2013/12/second-horseman-of-the-icd-10-apocalypse-documentation/\">Documentation</a> is lacking, incomplete, or unclear. Physicians may not document everything you need to select a code. And then you send a query and wait.\r\n\r\nThe longer you spend tracking down the physician for a query response, the lower your <a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/2014/01/third-horseman-of-the-icd-10-apocalypse-productivity/\">Productivity</a> becomes. If bills don’t get out the door, money doesn’t come in.\r\n\r\nLet’s look at some arbitrary apocalypse math to illustrate the cycle. These are obviously not real numbers. Every coder is different, every facility and office’s case mix is different, and everyone’s reimbursement is different.\r\n\r\nMary codes 10 inpatient records a day and those records represent $10,000 in reimbursement daily. If Mary’s productivity declines 20% simply because she is unfamiliar with ICD-10, $2,000 in revenue is not coming in each day.\r\n\r\nIf Mary’s productivity declines another 20% because she’s waiting on answers to queries, that’s another $2,000 a day not coming in. So far we’re down $4,000 a day (and a cumulative $20,000 for the week). That’s two days worth of revenue we’re losing from one coder. Multiply that by the number of coders at your office or facility and the number can get very scary, very quickly.\r\n\r\nSusan currently codes 20 outpatient records a day, representing $20,000 a day in revenue. Susan’s productivity only declines by 5%, resulting in a loss of $1,000 a day and $5,000 a week from lost productivity. That looks pretty good compared to Mary. At least at first glance.\r\n\r\nSusan, however, is only accurate 50% of the time. That means the other 50% of the records she codes are wrong. Wrong codes on the bill often result in either overpayment or underpayment.\r\n\r\nLet’s say Susan consistently undercodes. In some cases, the physicians don’t provide the documentation she needs, so she constantly defaults to unspecified codes. In some cases, unspecified codes are perfectly fine. Outpatient coders may use them more for fractures because the physician may be waiting on x-rays to determine which bone is broken and what type of fracture the patient has.\r\n\r\nThe <i>ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting</i> also tell us that a physician shouldn’t conduct medically unnecessary diagnostic testing in order to determine a more specific code. So if the patient has pneumonia, but the physician doesn’t know the causative organism, report an unspecified code instead of doing more tests to figure out the organism.\r\n\r\nSusan also misses codes, which again decreases revenue. At least if her coding is audited, we shouldn’t face takebacks.\r\n\r\nLet’s say Susan’s coding inaccuracy results in a loss of 25% of appropriate revenue. That works out to $5,000. Add the $1,000 a day lost to productivity declines and we’re down $6,000 a day and $30,000 a week. (If you want to be very concerned, that translates to $1,560,000 a year.) Again that’s one hypothetical coder. How long can you keep your doors open with that kind of reimbursement shortfall?\r\n\r\nOne thing that is out of our control is the accuracy of the payers’ systems. Do they have everything programmed and mapped correctly on their end? Have they updated all of their systems to accept ICD-10 codes? Have they translated all of the necessary policies and coverage determinations to reflect ICD-10 codes? Will our system talk to theirs?\r\n\r\nICD-10 is not just a coding change. It affects everything. Physicians need to document better. Coders need to learn a new system quickly AND accurately. IT has to make sure the information flows within the organization and also to payers. Payers need to make sure they are ready for the transition as well.\r\n\r\nIt really will take a healthcare village to make this work and defeat the Four Horsemen of the ICD-10 Apocalypse.',

Or do I have some deadly disease?\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Cupid.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-3300\" alt=\"Cupid\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Cupid-300x234.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"234\" /></a>What are my symptoms? Well, I feel lightheaded and dizzy. It could be the signs of new love or it could be acute mountain sickness.\r\n\r\nWhen we look up Sickness, mountain, in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index, we find two options:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>T70.29-, other effects of high altitude, which includes both alpine and mountain sickness</li>\r\n	<li>D75.1, secondary polycythemia, increased red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWell, I haven’t been to the mountains or any other high-altitude place recently, so I don’t think it’s mountain sickness.\r\n\r\nIt feels like a swarm of butterflies has taken up residency in my stomach every time I hear my beloved’s name mentioned. Could be love or generalized anxiety disorder. We can’t code love in ICD-10-CM, but we can code anxiety. In fact, we can code a lot of anxiety in ICD-10-CM. Just look at our choices:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>F41.0, panic disorder [episodic paroxysmal anxiety] without agoraphobia</li>\r\n	<li>F41.1, generalized anxiety disorder</li>\r\n	<li>F41.3, other mixed anxiety disorders</li>\r\n	<li>F41.8, other specified anxiety disorders</li>\r\n	<li>F41.9, anxiety disorder, unspecified</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe also have an Excludes2 note under Other Anxiety Disorders (F41):\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Acute stress reaction (F43.0)</li>\r\n	<li>Transient adjustment reaction (F43.2)</li>\r\n	<li>Neurasthenia (F48.8)</li>\r\n	<li>Psychophysiologic disorders (F45.-)</li>\r\n	<li>Separation anxiety (F93.0)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAn Excludes2 note means not included here. The condition excluded is not part of the condition under which it is listed, but a patient may have both conditions at the same time. So a patient could have both generalized anxiety disorder and an acute stress reaction. It’s okay to report both.\r\n\r\nI never thought of myself as the anxious type. What other symptoms do I have? I can’t sleep. Love or insomnia?\r\n\r\nWhat is the cause of my insomnia? Is it due to an anxiety disorder (there’s that word again)? If so, we would report F51.05 (insomnia due to other mental disorder). Note that we also need to code the specific mental disorder. ICD-10-CM says so.\r\n\r\nMaybe I had too much caffeine last night (F15.982). Hopefully this is a short-term situation (F51.02, adjustment insomnia).\r\n\r\nMoving on, my heart is all aflutter and my pulse is literally racing. Is it love or atrial fibrillation? (Please be love, please be love.)\r\n\r\nWith my luck, it’s atrial fibrillation. We need some more specific information to choose from these codes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>I48.0, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</li>\r\n	<li>I48.1, persistent atrial fibrillation</li>\r\n	<li>I48.2, chronic atrial fibrillation</li>\r\n	<li>I48.3, typical atrial flutter</li>\r\n	<li>I48.4, atypical atrial flutter</li>\r\n	<li>I48.9, unspecified atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nI48.9- actually has two subcategory codes (odd since it’s an unspecified code). They are also unspecified, but give a little more detail:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>I48.91, unspecified atrial fibrillation</li>\r\n	<li>I48.92, unspecified atrial flutter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nMaybe it’s just R00.2 (palpitations, awareness of heart beat).\r\n\r\nOn second thought, maybe I don’t want to be in love. I can’t handle the stress (and the palpations and butterflies and anxiety).',

class=\"MsoNormal\">In its continuing quest to halt ICD-10 implementation, the AMA is <a href=\"http://www.ama-assn.org/resources/doc/washington/icd-10-costs-for-physician-practices-study.pdf\">touting a new study by Nachimson Advisors</a> that shows much higher costs to physician practices than initially estimated in 2008.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Cadusius.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-3449\" alt=\"Cadusius\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Cadusius-300x300.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" /></a>In addition, the AMA contends <a href=\"http://www.ama-assn.org/resources/doc/washington/icd-10-letter-to-cms-12feb2014.pdf\">in a February 12 letter to HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius</a> that ICD-10 will not improve patient care, but instead “could disrupt efforts to transition to new delivery models.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In the initial 2008 study, Nachimson Advisors estimated that small physician practices would spend a median of $83,000 to implement ICD-10. The amount went up to $285,195 for medium practices and $2.7 million for larger practices.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In the updated 2014 study, Nachimson estimated the transition costs at:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li type=\"_moz\">$56,639‐ $226,105 for small practices</li>\r\n	<li type=\"_moz\">$213,364‐ $824,735 for medium practices</li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-family: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol;\"><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\"><span style=\"font: 7.0pt \'Times New Roman\';\"> </span></span></span>$2,017,151‐$8,018,364 for large practices</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The biggest potential costs are software upgrades and lost productivity. Those aren’t new concerns. Neither is the cost of ICD-10 implementation.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">We’ve known from the beginning that ICD-10 implementation would cost a lot of money and it would slow down productivity. Everything new costs money and slows down work.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">  </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Providers had an extra year to implement ICD-10, thanks in no small part to the AMA’s complaints. Smart organizations and practices used that time to spread out their costs, test their systems, and train their coders, billers, front-end staff, physicians, pretty much everyone but the custodial and kitchen staff.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">  </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The ones who counted on the AMA forcing another delay—or stopping ICD-10 altogether—didn’t. And in the end, they are the ones who will likely see higher costs. If you can spread out payments, like a mortgage, you can keep the costs more manageable. If you are trying to do everything all at once at the last minute, costs go up. It’s also more difficult to find a big chuck of money in one year’s budget.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The AMA also points out that physicians and coders will be going from approximately 16,000 ICD-9-CM codes to 68,000 ICD-10-CM codes. True, but the AMA fails to acknowledge two things:</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst\" style=\"text-indent: -.25in; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo2;\"><span style=\"mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;\"><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">1.<span style=\"font: 7.0pt \'Times New Roman\';\">     </span></span></span>No coder or physician is going to use all 68,000 codes. Most coders and physicians will use a small subset of codes the same way they do now. Cardiologists aren’t going to be using neurology codes. That cuts down on the number of possible codes.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpLast\" style=\"text-indent: -.25in; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo2;\"><span style=\"mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;\"><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">2.<span style=\"font: 7.0pt \'Times New Roman\';\">     </span></span></span>Some part of that increase in codes is due to laterality—you go from one ICD-9-CM code to three or four ICD-10-CM codes for a condition just by adding laterality.

To make sure the sheet didn’t slip, he tucked it in. And in the process, he injured the middle finger on his right hand.\r\n\r\nUndeterred by the drooping finger, Paul took Molly to the vet, where she got a clean bill of health, then left her with his friend Bruce while he took himself off to Fix ‘Em Up Clinic.\r\n\r\nDr. Neefe examined Paul’s finger and diagnosed mallet finger. Mallet finger is an injury of the extensor digitorum tendon of the finger at the distal interphalangeal joint. Fortunately, the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index lists mallet finger with three potential codes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Acquired, see Deformity, finger, mallet finger</li>\r\n	<li>Congenital, Q74.0</li>\r\n	<li>Sequelae of rickets, E64.3</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe know Paul suffered an injury, which makes it acquired mallet finger. So off we go to deformity. Not surprisingly, we have three code choices for an acquired mallet finger:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>M20.011, mallet finger of right finger(s)</li>\r\n	<li>M20.012, mallet finger of left finger(s)</li>\r\n	<li>M20.019, mallet finger of unspecified finger(s)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nICD-10-CM only requires laterality, not specificity for the individual finger. If Paul had developed mallet finger on more than one finger, we would still report the same code and only report it once.\r\n\r\nYou will need to check the record for some additional information, because mallet finger can simply be a tendon injury treated with a splint or it can be serious enough to require surgery.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, the tendon may pull a piece of the bone away when it breaks. If a patient has large fracture fragments or the joint becomes misaligned, the patient may require surgery.\r\n\r\nIn other cases, the nail may become detached. Fortunately, Paul only needs a splint and Dr. Neefe expects Paul will regain acceptable function and appearance with this treatment plan.\r\n\r\nMolly was very happy to see Paul return, even if he has a funny cover on his finger.',

That code includes glandular fever, monocytic angina, and Pfeiffer’s disease. Prepare to be shocked: ICD-10-CM offers many more choices for mono. The new codes identify the cause of the patient’s mononucleosis:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>B27.0, gammaherpesviral mononucleosis (also known as the Epstein-Barr virus)</li>\r\n	<li>B27.1, cytomegaloviral mononucleosis</li>\r\n	<li>B27.8, other infectious mononucleosis</li>\r\n	<li>B27.9, infectious mononucleosis, unspecified</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThose four codes are not reportable codes. If you try to report B27.0, you will either hit an edit or get the bill back from the insurance company. Why? Because each of those four codes includes four additional subcategories of codes to denote:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Without complications</li>\r\n	<li>With polyneuropathy</li>\r\n	<li>With meningitis</li>\r\n	<li>With other complication</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nNot only do we need to know the causative organism for mono, we also need to know what complications are present.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind though that we can report a code from the B27.9- series if the physician does not know the causative organism. You always want to report the most specific code, which would be from the B27.0-, B27.1-, or B27.8- series. However, the physician may be unable to determine the type of mono without additional tests.

The testing will include submission of test claims to CMS with ICD-10 cod<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/news-blocks.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-3712\" alt=\"news blocks\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/news-blocks-300x185.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"185\" /></a>es and the provider’s receipt of a Remittance Advice that explains the adjudication of the claims.\r\n\r\nThat’s a pretty vague plan, but at least it’s a plan. We don’t know yet how many providers will make up the small sample size or how CMS will pick the providers. CMS states that the providers will represent a broad cross-section of provider types, claims types, and submitter types.\r\n\r\nIn its letter to CMS urging recommending another ICD-10 implementation delay, the AMA recommended that CMS conduct end-to-end testing with at least 100 different physician practices of varying sizes and specialties.\r\n\r\nSummer 2014 is also a vague timeframe. Is CMS going to conduct testing in May (summer officially begins June 21) or will it wait until September (the first day of fall is September 23)?\r\n\r\nWhen CMS conducts the testing could be as important as the results. If CMS tests early (April-June), fewer organizations may be ready to test, limiting the potential sample size. If CMS waits (August-September), organizations may not have enough time to correct problems prior to ICD-10 implementation.\r\n\r\nMACs will be conducting front-end testing March 3-7 with trading partners, such as healthcare organizations, according to<a href=\"http://www.cms.gov/Outreach-and-Education/Medicare-Learning-Network-MLN/MLNMattersArticles/Downloads/MM8465.pdf\"><i> MLN Matters MM8465</i></a>. It is not a full-cycle test and the MACs will not adjudicate the claims. In <i>MLN Matters SE1409</i>, CMS stated it will consider adding additional weeks of front-end testing as well.\r\n\r\nAs nice as it would be for CMS to conduct end-to-end testing with every organization, that’s not very realistic. I’m interested to see what sample size CMS uses, which providers it chooses, and how the testing goes. I’d love to see CMS conduct end-to-end testing with some of the organizations that run into problems during the front-end testing.\r\n\r\nCMS also did not state whether it would publish the results of the testing or call out common problems. So we’ll have to wait and see. At least CMS will perform some end-to-end testing and that’s a step in the right direction.',

Granted some of those codes are silly or strange or seem pointless.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/question-marks.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-3439\" alt=\"question marks\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/question-marks-300x300.jpg\" width=\"202\" height=\"202\" /></a>The ICD-10-CM guidelines point out that coders are not to report External Causes codes. Some states or payers may require External Causes, but reporting these codes is otherwise optional. However, the guidelines recommend reporting these codes anyway because they provide valuable data.\r\n\r\nSo you don’t need to report W58.11XA (bitten by crocodile, initial encounter) or X06.1XXA (exposure to melting of plastic jewelry, initial encounter). The codes are there, they help tell a better story about the patient, and they can be useful for data collection.\r\n\r\nExternal Causes codes include some very detailed codes for injuries involving motor vehicles, such as:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>V39.50-, passenger in three-wheeled motor vehicle injured in collision with unspecified motor vehicles in traffic accident</li>\r\n	<li>V43.42-, person boarding or alighting a car injured in collision with other type car</li>\r\n	<li>V65.00, driver of heavy transport vehicle injured in collision with railway train or railway vehicle in non-traffic accident</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThose aren’t the codes you need to worry about, though. Instead of focusing on the External Causes codes, coders (and the AMA, media, and Congress) should be looking at the injury and illness codes. For example, in Chapter 19 (Injury, poisoning and certain other consequences of external causes [S00-T88]), we find six choices in category S90.1- (contusion of toe without damage to nail):\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S90.111-, contusion of right great toe without damage to nail</li>\r\n	<li>S90.112-, contusion of left great toe without damage to nail</li>\r\n	<li>S90.119-, contusion of unspecified great toe without damage to nail</li>\r\n	<li>S90.121-, contusion of right lesser toe(s) without damage to nail</li>\r\n	<li>S90.122-, contusion of left lesser toe(s) without damage to nail</li>\r\n	<li>S90.129-, contusion of unspecified lesser toe(s) without damage to nail</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIn order to be valid codes, each of those choices needs a seventh character:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>A, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>D, subsequent encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S, sequela</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSo in reality, we have 21 possible codes for a contusion of the toe without damage to the nail. In ICD-9-CM, we have one possible code: 924.3 (contusion of toe). We also have 21 codes for contusion of a toe with damage to nail. Still reporting 924.3 in ICD-9-CM.\r\n\r\nIf you want to talk about the increased number of codes and the increased specificity and granularity of ICD-10-CM, those are the kind of codes you should be discussing. Those are the codes that are clinically significant and describe the patient’s condition. Those are the codes we need better documentation to report. Those are the codes that will get us paid.\r\n\r\nWorry about those codes and their details and leave the External Causes alone.',

How would you code that in ICD-10-CM?<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/shutterstock_86443981.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-3813\" alt=\"shutterstock_86443981\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/shutterstock_86443981-300x300.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a>\r\n\r\nIt depends on why you’re hearing voices. People hear voices all the time, sometimes for totally benign reasons. For example, you may hear voices when you fall asleep. Not to worry, they’re just hypnagogic hallucinations, part of falling asleep.\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM includes six different codes for hallucinations, including one for auditory hallucinations (R44.0). You’ll find these codes under category R44 (other symptoms and signs involving general sensations and perceptions). You would only report these codes if the physician doesn’t know why the patient is hallucinating.\r\n\r\nHowever, plenty of medical conditions also cause hallucinations. For example, people who abuse drugs and alcohol can experience hallucinations. For these patients, you would need to know whether their drug or alcohol use falls under:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Use</li>\r\n	<li>Abuse</li>\r\n	<li>Dependence</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThis is a new concept in ICD-10-CM. Use, abuse, and dependence even have their own hierarchy. The ICD-10-CM guidelines tell us the following:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>If both use and abuse are documented, assign only the code for abuse</li>\r\n	<li>If both abuse and dependence are documented, assign only the code for dependence</li>\r\n	<li>If use, abuse and dependence are all documented, assign only the code for dependence</li>\r\n	<li>If both use and dependence are documented, assign only the code for dependence</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nDependence, when documented, always trumps use and abuse.\r\n\r\nIn ICD-10-CM, you’ll find the code broken out by substance causing the psychotic disorder (i.e. hallucinations). Our choices include:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>F10.251, alcohol dependence with alcohol-induced psychotic disorder with hallucinations</li>\r\n	<li>F11.151, opioid abuse with opioid-induced psychotic disorder with hallucinations</li>\r\n	<li>F12.951, cannabis use, unspecified with psychotic disorder with hallucinations</li>\r\n	<li>F13.251, sedative, hypnotic or anxiolytic dependence with sedative, hypnotic or anxiolytic-induced psychotic disorder with hallucinations</li>\r\n	<li>F14.951, cocaine use, unspecified with cocaine-induced psychotic disorder with hallucinations</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe need documentation of the substance and the level of use, as well as the specific psychotic symptom.\r\n\r\nAlternately, a patient may be suffering from a mental illness that is causing his or her hallucinations. Schizophrenia may be the mental illness that comes to mind. If the patient does indeed suffer from schizophrenia, we need to know the type in order to choose from these codes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>F20.0, paranoid schizophrenia</li>\r\n	<li>F20.1, disorganized schizophrenia</li>\r\n	<li>F20.2, catatonic schizophrenia</li>\r\n	<li>F20.3, undifferentiated schizophrenia</li>\r\n	<li>F20.5, residual schizophrenia</li>\r\n	<li>F20.81, schizophreniform disorder</li>\r\n	<li>F20.89, other schizophrenia</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nMany of these codes feature a list of inclusive terms underneath them. For example, catatonic schizophrenia includes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Schizophrenic catalepsy</li>\r\n	<li>Schizophrenic catatonia</li>\r\n	<li>Schizophrenic flexibilitas cerea</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nPatients with major depressive disorder may also hear voices. In order to code this condition, we need to know whether the patient is suffering from a single episode with psychotic features (F32.3) or recurrent major depressive disorder with psychotic symptoms (F33.3).\r\n\r\nBipolar patients may also suffer from auditory hallucinations. ICD-10-CM breaks down the bipolar disorder codes to identify the type of episode the patient has:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>F31.2, bipolar disorder, current episode manic severe with psychotic features</li>\r\n	<li>F31.5, bipolar disorder, current episode depressed, severe, with psychotic features</li>\r\n	<li>F31.64, bipolar disorder, current episode mixed, severe, with psychotic features</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nPatients suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may also hallucinate. The ICD-10-CM codes for PTSD do not specify whether the patient is suffering from psychotic symptoms. They are divided into:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Acute (F43.11)</li>\r\n	<li>Chronic (F43.12)</li>\r\n	<li>Unspecified (F43.10)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nA range of organic brain disorders, such as brain tumors, temporal lobe epilepsy, and viral encephalitis, can also cause hallucinations. If the hallucinations are integral to the disease process, we don’t code them separately. You may need to ask a clinician or clinical documentation improvement specialist if you’re not sure.\r\n\r\nIf you’ll excuse me, I hear a cookie calling my name.',

Outpatient coders can’t do that. They need a confirmed diagnosis.\r\n\r\nHowever, in one case, inpatient coders always must have a confirmed diagnosis in order to report the condition: HIV. Regardless of setting, coders can only code confirmed cases of HIV. You don’t need a diagnostic lab test for a confirmation. In this context, you just need the provider’s diagnostic statement that the patient is HIV-positive, or has an HIV-related illness.\r\n\r\nPatients with HIV can suffer from a host of related conditions, so you need to know the sequencing guidelines. Here’s the good news: the guidelines in ICD-10-CM are the same as the guidelines in ICD-9-CM. They just look different.\r\n\r\nSo, a quick review of HIV coding guidelines.\r\n\r\nIf the patient is admitted for an HIV-related condition, report B20 (human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] disease) as the principal diagnosis, followed by additional diagnosis codes for all reported HIV-related conditions.\r\n\r\nIf the patient is admitted for an unrelated illness or injury, such as a traumatic fracture, sequence the unrelated condition as the principal diagnosis, followed by B20 and coders for any reported HIV-related conditions.\r\n\r\nRemember that whether the patient is newly or previously diagnosed does not affect sequencing. You go by the reason for the admission.\r\n\r\nWhat happens when a physician documents that a patient is HIV-positive, but has no symptoms? Report Z21 (asymptomatic human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection status). You would not use the Z code if the physician documents that the patient has AIDS, or is treating the patient for any HIV-related illness, or describes the patient as having any condition(s) resulting from his/her HIV-positive status. Z21 is only for asymptomatic cases of HIV.\r\n\r\nOnce a patient has developed an HIV-related illness, you will always assign code B20 on every subsequent admission/encounter. Never report R75 (inconclusive laboratory evidence of human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]) or Z21 for patients previously diagnosed with any HIV illness. Once a patient has HIV, he or she always has HIV. We haven’t cured it yet.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;',

		'body' : 'Almost all of the ICD-10-PCS root operations describe very specific intent. Think about the difference between root operations excision and resection. Excision involves removing some of a body part and Resection is removing all of the body part. <a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/guidelines1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-3346\" alt=\"guidelines\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/guidelines1-300x170.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"170\" /></a>That’s a tricky nuance especially when ICD-10-PCS body part values include lobes of organs. If the physician removes the right middle lobe of the patient’s lung, we’ll use root operation resection because ICD-10-PCS gives each lobe of the lung its own body part value.\r\n\r\nThen we have root operation Repair. In ICD-10-PCS, Repair is almost a not elsewhere classified kind of root operation. Even the official definition is somewhat vague: Restoring, to the extent possible, a body part to its normal anatomic structure and function.\r\n\r\nWe’ll only use Repair when the method used to accomplish the repair is not one of the other root operations. For example, if the physician performs a herniorrhaphy, we would code Repair. However, if the physician used mesh to perform the herniorrhaphy, we would go to the root operation Supplement (putting in device that reinforces or augments a body part). The physician implanted mesh (a device) to shore up the weak spot, so the procedure is no longer a simple repair.\r\n\r\nWhat does qualify as a repair? For one, suturing a laceration, such as:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>0LQ30ZZ, suture repair of right biceps tendon laceration, open</li>\r\n	<li>0WQF0ZZ, closure of abdominal wall stab wound</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nOne more thing to keep in mind—closure of an operative incision does not qualify as a repair. Closing the patient is an integral part of the surgical procedure.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;',

First, ICD-10-CM distinguishes between pre-existing conditions and those caused by pregnancy.\r\n\r\nA patient may be diabetic and become pregnant or the patient may develop gestational diabetes. We will use different codes to report those conditions.\r\n\r\nIf a pregnant patient has pre-existing type 2 diabetes mellitus and is in her second trimester, report O24.112.\r\n\r\nNote that the first character is a capital letter O, not a zero. All ICD-10-CM codes begin with letters. However, zeroes will appear in other places in the codes.\r\n\r\nCodes for pre-existing type I diabetes are found under O24.0-. However, if the physician does not denote the type of pre-existing diabetes, use a code from O24.3-.\r\n\r\nThe <i>Official ICD-10-CM Guidelines for Coding and Reporting</i> instruct us to first assign the code from O24 (diabetes mellitus in pregnancy, childbirth, and the puerperium), followed by the appropriate diabetes code(s) from E08-E13.\r\n\r\nIf the patient is controlling her diabetes with insulin, we also need to report Z79.4 (long-term use of insulin).\r\n\r\nGestational diabetes generally occurs in the second or third trimester and can cause the same problems as pre-existing diabetes.\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM divides gestational diabetes into three time periods of the pregnancy:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>O24.41-, gestational diabetes mellitus in pregnancy</li>\r\n	<li>O24.42, gestational diabetes mellitus in childbirth</li>\r\n	<li>O24.43, gestational diabetes mellitus in the puerperium</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nCode O24.41- is further subdivided by how the patient is controlling her diabetes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>O24.410, gestational diabetes mellitus in pregnancy, diet controlled</li>\r\n	<li>O24.414, gestational diabetes mellitus in pregnancy, insulin controlled</li>\r\n	<li>O24.419, gestational diabetes mellitus in pregnancy, unspecified control</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIf the patient controls her diabetes with both diet and insulin, we only need to report the insulin controlled code.\r\n\r\nWhen we report a code from O24.4-, we will not report any other code from O24, according to the official guidelines.\r\n\r\nWe also will not report Z79.4.\r\n\r\nWhat happens if our physician doesn’t tell us whether the diabetes is pre-existing or gestational? ICD-10-CM has a code set for that:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>O24.91-, unspecified diabetes mellitus in pregnancy</li>\r\n	<li>O24.92, unspecified diabetes mellitus in childbirth</li>\r\n	<li>O24.93, unspecified diabetes mellitus in the puerperium</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nO24.91- is further divided by trimester:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>O24.911, unspecified diabetes mellitus in pregnancy, first trimester</li>\r\n	<li>O24.912, unspecified diabetes mellitus in pregnancy, second trimester</li>\r\n	<li>O24.913, unspecified diabetes mellitus in pregnancy, third trimester</li>\r\n	<li>O24.919, unspecified diabetes mellitus in pregnancy, unspecified trimester</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nFor these codes, we would report long-term insulin use when appropriate.',

The other senators all joined in, stabbing the “Dictator for Life” repeatedly about the head. Perhaps the unkindest cut of all came from Caesar’s protégé, Marcus Brutus, who wounded Caesar in the groin.\r\n\r\nIf Caesar came into the Acme ED for treatment of his wounds, we would first need to identify where the stab wounds occurred.\r\n\r\nDr. M. Antony documents a stab wound to the neck and multiple stab wounds to the head. Can we code that? Let’s start by looking up “stab” in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index. The index directs us to “see also, laceration.”\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM offers us a wealth of laceration codes for laceration of the neck:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S11.21, laceration without foreign body of pharynx and cervical esophagus</li>\r\n	<li>S11.22, laceration with foreign body of pharynx and cervical esophagus</li>\r\n	<li>S11.81, laceration without foreign body of other specified part of neck</li>\r\n	<li>S11.82, laceration with foreign body of other specified part of neck</li>\r\n	<li>S11.91, laceration without foreign body of unspecified part of neck</li>\r\n	<li>S11.92, laceration with foreign body of unspecified part of neck</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe larynx, pharynx, thyroid gland, and trachea have their own laceration codes, so if Casca lacerated Caesar’s trachea and cervical esophagus, we would need two codes.\r\n\r\nTwo things to notice about the laceration codes for the neck—they don’t specify laterality, but they do require a seventh character. Since the codes are only five characters long, we need to add a placeholder X before our seventh character.\r\n\r\nFor Caesar’s head wounds, we need to know where the blade struck. ICD-10-CM includes codes for laceration to the:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Cheek (which also includes the temporomandibular area)</li>\r\n	<li>Ear</li>\r\n	<li>Head</li>\r\n	<li>Lip</li>\r\n	<li>Nose</li>\r\n	<li>Oral cavity</li>\r\n	<li>Scalp</li>\r\n	<li>Specified site not elsewhere classified</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe codes for lacerations of the cheek and the ear do include laterality, so we’ll need to know which one was involved or if both were injured.\r\n\r\nWe also need to know if the wound contains a foreign body (a piece of the dagger in Caesar’s case) and the encounter. If Caesar suffered bilateral cheek lacerations without foreign body, we’ll report two codes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S01.411A, laceration without foreign body of right cheek and temporomandibular area, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S01.412A, laceration without foreign body of left cheek and temporomandibular area, initial encounter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAnd now for Caesar’s final wound, courtesy of Brutus. Under laceration, groin, we find a note telling us to see laceration, abdomen, wall.\r\n\r\nFor a laceration of the abdominal wall, we need to know which quadrant was involved, whether a foreign body remains in the wound, whether the laceration penetrated the peritoneal cavity, and the encounter. All for one code.\r\n\r\nSo if Dr. Antony documented an initial visit for a laceration to the lower right quadrant, without foreign body and without penetration into the peritoneal cavity, we would report S31.123A.\r\n\r\nWe can add some External Causes codes so history knows what happened to poor Caesar. Keep in mind that External Causes codes are not mandatory in most cases. They just tell a more complete story. So for Caesar’s assassination, we would report:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>X99.2XXA, assault by sword or dagger, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>Y92.29, other specified public building as the place of occurrence of the external cause (the Senate)</li>\r\n	<li>Y99.0, civilian activity done for income or pay (ruling Rome is a big job after all)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou could make a case for Y99.1 (military activity) since Caesar was Rome’s supreme military commander, but overseeing the Senate is more of a civilian job.\r\n\r\nRemember to beware the Ides of March and avoid sharp objects!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;',

Said reptile was not pleased to have its sunbathing interrupted and was not the least bit interested in Sean’s St. Patrick’s Day plan. In fact, the snake was so unhappy with Sean that it bite him—repeatedly.\r\n\r\nFortunately for Sean, the snake was not venomous, so all he has to show for his efforts is multiple bite marks (and a slightly hysterical mother).\r\n\r\nIn order to code Sean’s injuries, we need to know first whether the snake is venomous or non-venomous. If the snake was venomous, we would look up venom, snake, in the Table of Drugs and Chemicals, by animal, poisoning. In case you’re interested, the Table of Drugs and Chemicals names nine different types of snakes, but three include the distinction Not Elsewhere Classified (meaning we know the type of snake, but don’t have a specific code for that species).\r\n\r\nWe already know the snake was non-venomous, so we look under bite, snake, non-venomous, and the ICD-10-CM Index of Diseases tells us to look up bite, by site.\r\n\r\nWe will need a separate code for each snake bite, so if the snake bit Sean on the right lower leg, left lower leg, and right hand, we would report:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S80.871A, other superficial bite, right lower leg, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S80.872A, other superficial bite, left lower leg, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S60.571A, other superficial bite of hand of right hand, initial encounter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese codes include laterality, which is great since the snake bit Sean on both the left and right lower legs. Having laterality tells the payer we didn’t accidentally report the same code twice, our patient did indeed suffer two distinct injuries.\r\n\r\nThe codes also require a seventh character to denote the encounter. Without the A (initial encounter), D (subsequent encounter), or S (sequela) in the seventh position, the code is invalid.\r\n\r\nWe can add some External Causes codes to better explain what happened to Sean:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>W59.11XA, bitten by nonvenomous snake (don’t forget the placeholder and seventh character)</li>\r\n	<li>Y92.096, garden or yard of other non-institutional residence as the place of occurrence of the external cause</li>\r\n	<li>Y99.8, other external cause status</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSadly, we do not have an External Causes code for snake herding or religious reenactment.\r\n\r\nLiam managed to avoid snakes on St. Patrick’s Day, but alas, he could not forgo the green beer and green cheese. The beer was supposed to be green, but the cheese was not. As a result, poor Liam is suffering from food poisoning. Luckily, he didn’t pick up salmonella or E. coli or any other fungus-borne illness.\r\n\r\nFood poisoning is found in the Table of Drugs and Chemicals, where we find options for, among other things:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Berries</li>\r\n	<li>Mushrooms</li>\r\n	<li>Plants</li>\r\n	<li>Seafood</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nMoldy cheese didn’t make the list, but we do have our tried and true standby, specified, not elsewhere classified. So we would assign T62.8X1A (toxic effect of other specified noxious substances eaten as food, accidental [unintentional]). Liam intentionally ate the cheese, but he did not try to poison himself, so we’re going with accidental.\r\n\r\nOur final patient for the day is Bridget. She was out scouring the park looking for four-leaf clovers. Instead, she found a patch of poison ivy. Everywhere she came into contact with the pretty plant is now extremely itchy, sports a red, streaky rash, and in some places, grew red bumps and large, weeping blisters.\r\n\r\nFortunately, her illness isn’t fatal. It isn’t even catching. It’s simply contact dermatitis. In ICD-10-CM we need to know what caused the allergic reaction (plant, animal, drugs, etc.). Since poison ivy is the culprit, we would report L23.7 (allergic contact dermatitis due to plants, except food). A little calamine lotion and hydrocortisone cream will help with the itching and blistering, and in no time Bridget will be good as new.\r\n\r\nLá Fhéile Pádraig Sona Daoibh!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;',

For example, if a patient is diagnosed with transient hypertension in pregnancy, you would report 642.3x. The fifth digit denotes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>0, unspecified as to episode of care or not applicable</li>\r\n	<li>1, delivered, with or without mention of antepartum condition</li>\r\n	<li>2, delivered, with mention of postpartum complication</li>\r\n	<li>3, antepartum condition or complication</li>\r\n	<li>4, postpartum condition or complication</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIn ICD-10-CM, the codes specify the trimester of the pregnancy in which the condition occurred. For example, if a patient is diagnosed with antepartum transient hypertension (ICD-9-CM code 642.33), you have four choices in ICD-10-CM:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>O13.1, gestational [pregnancy-induced] hypertension without significant proteinuria, first trimester</li>\r\n	<li>O13.2, gestational [pregnancy-induced] hypertension without significant proteinuria, second trimester</li>\r\n	<li>O13.3, gestational [pregnancy-induced] hypertension without significant proteinuria, third trimester</li>\r\n	<li>O13.9, gestational [pregnancy-induced] hypertension without significant proteinuria, unspecified trimester</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nNote that the first character is a capital O not a zero. All ICD-10-CM codes start with a letter. However, you may see a zero or two later in some codes.\r\n\r\nCoding for multiple fetuses will also present some challenges. ICD-10-CM codes specify the number of fetuses as well as whether the fetuses are monochorionic (share the same placenta) and/or monoamniotic (share the same amniotic sac). The codes are further divided by trimester.\r\n\r\nA patient comes in for care related to the fetus and possible delivery problems. She is pregnant with twins and is in her second trimester. Our possible codes include:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>O30.002, twin pregnancy, unspecified number of placenta and unspecified number of amniotic sacs, second trimester</li>\r\n	<li>O30.012, twin pregnancy, monochorionic/monoamniotic, second trimester</li>\r\n	<li>O30.022, conjoined twin pregnancy, second trimester</li>\r\n	<li>O30.032, twin pregnancy, monochorionic/diamniotic, second trimester</li>\r\n	<li>O30.042, twin pregnancy, dichorionic/diamniotic, second trimester</li>\r\n	<li>O30.092, twin pregnancy, unable to determine number of placenta and number of amniotic sacs, second trimester</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nNote the difference between O30.002 and O30.092. Use O30.002 if the physician does not specify the number of placentas or amniotic sacs. If the physician documents that he or she cannot tell how many there are, use O30.092.\r\n\r\nAnother aspect worth noting is the seventh character for complications of labor and delivery (O60-O77). The seventh character identifies the fetus involved. If the mom is only carrying one, the seventh character is always 0. That’s pretty easy.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the mother is carrying multiple fetuses, you need to look for documentation that specifies which fetus is affected. For example, if the physician documents obstructed labor due to breech presentation for one twin, he or she needs to specify fetus 1 or fetus 2. If fetus 2 is involved, report O64.1XX2. The base code is only four characters long, so we need two X placeholders to move the seventh character to the seventh position.\r\n\r\nWe also need to assign a code from category O30 when multiple fetuses are involved.\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM includes codes that specify when a condition, such as hypertension or diabetes, is pre-existing (meaning before the patient became pregnant) and when it is due to the pregnancy.\r\n\r\nCodes from Chapter 15 take precedence over codes from other chapters unless the provider documents that the pregnancy is incidental to the encounter. For example, a pregnant woman cuts her hand on broken glass and needs stitches. The injury has nothing to do with pregnancy. The fact that she is pregnant doesn’t impact care unless, for some reason, she would need anesthesia. In this case, you would report the laceration and also report Z33.1 (pregnant state, incidental).\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM also includes Z codes to denote the weeks of gestation. Codes from category Z3A.- are for use, only on the maternal record, to indicate the weeks of gestation of the pregnancy. Code first complications of pregnancy, childbirth, and the puerperium (O00-O9A).\r\n\r\nThe specified weeks of gestation go from less than eight (Z3A.01) all the way through more than 42 weeks gestation of pregnancy (Z3A.49).',

You may need a qualifier to further specify the level where the extremity was detached.\r\n\r\nFor example, the physician amputates the patient’s right upper arm. When we look at the table (0X6), we first see body part choices for:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Right upper arm</li>\r\n	<li>Left upper arm</li>\r\n	<li>Right lower arm</li>\r\n	<li>Left lower arm</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe approach is always open and your only device choice is no device. When we get to the qualifier, we have three options:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>1, high</li>\r\n	<li>2, mid</li>\r\n	<li>3, low</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe physician needs to document where he or she performed the detachment. If that information is not in the operative report, query. We do not have unspecified or default codes in ICD-10-PCS. The codes for detachment of the leg include the same choices.\r\n\r\nCMS’ <i>ICD-10-PCS Reference Manual </i>defines the qualifiers as:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>High: amputation at the proximal portion of the shaft of the humerus or femur</li>\r\n	<li>Mid: amputation at the middle portion of the shaft of the humerus or femur</li>\r\n	<li>Low: amputation at the distal portion of the shaft of the humerus or femur</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe can choose from even more possibilities when it comes to a detachment of the hand. In addition to laterality for the body part (right hand or left hand), we also need to know whether the physician removed the complete hand (qualifier 0) or only part. If only part, which part? Our choices include:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>4, complete 1st ray</li>\r\n	<li>5, complete 2nd ray</li>\r\n	<li>6, complete 3rd ray</li>\r\n	<li>7, complete 4th ray</li>\r\n	<li>8, complete 5th ray</li>\r\n	<li>9, partial 1st ray</li>\r\n	<li>B, partial 2nd ray</li>\r\n	<li>C, partial 3rd ray</li>\r\n	<li>D, partial 4th ray</li>\r\n	<li>F, partial 5th ray</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou’ll see the same options for detachment of the foot (OY6).\r\n\r\nPerhaps the surgeon only removes a digit (finger or toe). We need to know the specific digit, such as right thumb or left little toe. We also see these four qualifier choices:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>0, complete</li>\r\n	<li>1, high</li>\r\n	<li>2, mid</li>\r\n	<li>3, low</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBe sure the physicians are documenting the detail you need to code for a detachment. You should also brush up on your anatomy of the hand and foot (and make sure you know what a ray is) if you see these procedures in your facility.',

Unlike previous attempts, such as the <a href=\"https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr1701\">Cutting Costly Codes Act</a> introduced in 2013, H.R. 4015 is not focused on ICD-10 implementation.

Tucked into the bill was one sentence that could significantly impact the healthcare industry:\r\n\r\n<i>The Secretary of Health and Human Services may not, prior to October 1, 2015, adopt ICD–10 code sets  as the standard for code sets under section 1173(c) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1320d–2(c)) and section 162.1002 of title 45, Code of Federal Regulations.</i>\r\n\r\nThe Senate is now expected to vote on the same bill Monday around 2 p.m. (Eastern).\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/question-marks.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-3439\" alt=\"question marks\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/question-marks-300x300.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a>No one seems quite sure who introduced the delay language into the bill, which is a compromise bill worked out by House and Senate leadership. The idea for the delay could have come from the AMA, which has been quite vocal in its opposition to ICD-10.\r\n\r\nHowever, the AMA and numerous specialty societies sent a letter asking Congress NOT to pass this bill. They want a permanent fix to the SGR. They almost got one, too. The House passed a bill March 14 that would have fixed the SGR, but the Senate failed to pass it. Hence, the compromise with the additional language to delay ICD-10.\r\n\r\nI actually feel kind of bad for CMS (never thought I would say that). The agency’s representatives have repeatedly and forcefully stated CMS was not changing the implementation date. Now, it might not have a choice. Congress could force CMS to change the date and at that point, who will take a new implementation date seriously?\r\n\r\nAnd speaking of a new implementation date, notice that the language in the bill says CMS may not require ICD-10 “prior to October 1, 2015.” That doesn’t mean October 1, 2015, would be the new implementation date. So the date could get pushed back to 2016 or 2017. It will also reignite the debate about whether we should just wait for ICD-11. (Um, NO, we absolutely should not.)\r\n\r\nAHIMA quoted a CMS estimate that a one-year delay could cost the industry between $1 billion and $6.6 billion. Healthcare providers are already feeling the pinch of budget constraints now and have spent literally billions on preparations so far. Who has the extra money to retrain coders and CDI and physicians when they have already provided training this year?\r\n\r\nWe would also be looking at a longer code freeze. The last regular update for ICD-9-CM happened back in 2011. If ICD-10 is delayed again, we’re looking at no new codes until at least October 2016.\r\n\r\nDuring the House debate, no one talked about ICD-10, they all talked about the SGR. I fear the same will happen in the Senate. Because Congress doesn’t want to face the specter of a 24% cut in physician payments scheduled to hit April 1, the Senate will probably pass the SGR one-year fix. Which means they will probably also mandate the ICD-10 delay.\r\n\r\nHopefully, CMS, AHIMA, and like-minded organizations can do some wining and dining (and maybe some arm twisting) over the weekend to get the ICD-10 delay language removed. Sadly, I’m not optimistic.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;',

These codes are only used on the mother’s record.</li>\r\n	<li>Chapter 16, Certain Conditions Originating in the Perinatal Period (P00-P96). These codes are only reported for the newborn. These codes include conditions that have their origin in the fetal or perinatal period (before birth through the first 28 days after birth) even if morbidity occurs later.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nMake sure you code all clinically significant conditions noted on a routine newborn examination. A condition is clinically significant if it requires any of the following:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Clinical evaluation</li>\r\n	<li>Therapeutic treatment</li>\r\n	<li>Diagnostic procedures</li>\r\n	<li>Extended length of hospital stay</li>\r\n	<li>Increased nursing care and/or monitoring</li>\r\n	<li>Has implications for future health care needs</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWhat types of problems can newborns have? Well, the baby may arrive too early. We would use codes from category P07.3- to report 28 completed weeks or more but less than 37 completed weeks (196 completed days but less than 259 completed days) of gestation.\r\n\r\nWe have nine different choices to specify exactly how early our bundle of joy arrived, plus an unspecified code. If the newborn arrives at 31 weeks, four days, we would report P07.34.\r\n\r\nMaybe our baby is underweight for gestational age. ICD-10-CM includes codes for:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>P07.0-, extremely low birth weight newborn</li>\r\n	<li>P07.1-, other low birth weight newborn</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe codes in these categories specify weight ranges. So if the newborn weighs 850 grams at birth, we would report P07.03 (extremely low birth weight newborn, 750-999 grams).\r\n\r\nSo we have a preemie with a low birth weight. Which condition do we sequence as the principal diagnosis for the birth encounter? It’s a trick question because the answer is neither. When coding the birth episode in a newborn record, we will always assign a code from category Z38.- (liveborn infant) as the principal diagnosis. Birth takes precedence.\r\n\r\nZ38.- still gives us plenty of options and we need some specific details to choose the correct code. First, how many babies? Where did the baby arrive? How was the baby delivered? You could conceivably have a different place and method if mom is delivering more than one baby.\r\n\r\nFor example, if mom gives birth to twins in the hospital, she could deliver one vaginally (Z38.30) and one by cesarean (Z38.31).\r\n\r\nAlternately, she could have one on the way to the hospital (Z38.4, twin liveborn infant, born outside hospital) and one vaginally in the hospital. Don’t assume it will be the same for each infant in a multiple birth.\r\n\r\nChapter 16 codes may be used throughout the life of the patient if the condition is still present.',

We have no idea who voted for or against the bill. In fact, we’re not even sure who voted.\r\n\r\nAfter a weekend to mull the possibilities, the Senate passed the bill March 31 by a 64-35 margin. President Obama signed it into law April 1. How I wish that were a joke.\r\n\r\nSo where does that leave us?\r\n\r\nWell, we are still without a new ICD-10 implementation date. Make no mistake, ICD-10 is coming. We’re just back to not knowing exactly when.\r\n\r\nThe transition to ICD-10 “remains inevitable and time-sensitive because of the potential risk to public health and the need to track, identify, and analyze new clinical services and treatments available for patients,” according to an AHIMA statement.\r\n\r\nCMS is still considering a new date. The congressional bill doesn’t stipulate a new date. It just says HHS can’t mandate ICD-10 before October 1, 2015.\r\n\r\nWe also don’t know what will happen with the American Hospital Association\'s (AHA) <i>Coding Clinic</i>. The AHA stopped accepting ICD-9 questions in January and was shifting to answering solely ICD-10 questions. Will <i>Coding Clinic</i> start accepting ICD-9 questions again? According to the AHA, staff members are currently evaluating how they will move forward. Stay tuned.\r\n\r\nAHIMA, AAPC, AHA, the Association for Clinical Documentation Improvement Specialists (ACDIS), and CMS are all stressing the same message: Don’t stop your implementation plans.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, when CMS delayed ICD-10 implementation from October 1, 2013, to October 1, 2014, many organizations put the brakes on their implementation plans. That turned out to be a big mistake, because many organizations reported having trouble regaining the momentum they lost. Now we get to find out how well we learned that lesson.\r\n\r\nOrganizations still need to figure out some other things, and while I would love to be able to give you a clear-cut, here-is-what-you-do plan, I can’t. Every organization is different. What works for a big health system won’t fly at a small physician practice. So you need to think about where you are right now, what you still need to accomplish before implementation, and how long it will take to complete that work. Then create a reasonable plan with milestones and measureable goals and use this delay to your advantage.',

Are all of your coders trained? Are they in the process of being trained? How are you going to keep their skills sharp until they actually start coding in ICD-10? If you are currently dual coding, will you continue to do so? You can use this extra time to add to coders’ clinical knowledge and comfort level with ICD-10.\r\n\r\n<b>Documentation</b>: Here’s where you can really use the delay to your advantage. Start updating your EHR and query forms now. You have more time to make changes and get physicians used to the changes. Not sure where your physician documentation is falling short? You have more time to pinpoint the biggest problem areas, but you need to take advantage of the extra time.\r\n\r\n<b>Leadership buy-in (and, of course, money)</b>: Did you have trouble getting your CFO on board with spending lots of money to revamp everything for ICD-10? He or she is probably not very happy right now. Don’t let the leadership slack off on ICD-10 implementation plans.\r\n\r\n<b>Physician engagement</b>: This is probably one of the biggest hurdles to ICD-10 implementation. A lot of organizations struggled to get physicians engaged in learning documentation requirements for ICD-10 before this latest delay. I think the problem is only going to get worse. Physicians will drag their heels and say, \"why should I learn this? It’s never going to be implemented.\" Before you talk with your physicians, make sure you have answers ready. Explain why ICD-10 is better (more specificity, better clinical picture of the patient, use of physician terminology—think asthma descriptions). Tell them how it will help their ratings and improve patient care. Stress that we don’t want them to code, we just want them to completely and accurately document their patients’ conditions and the procedures they performed.\r\n\r\nWe have two choices when it comes to this delay: put our ICD-10 preparations on hold (not really a good plan) or find ways to use the extra time to our advantage.',

The codes just look a little different.\r\n\r\nIn ICD-10-CM, we can assign one of the following codes for a patient with mumps:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>B26.1, mumps orchitis</li>\r\n	<li>B26.1, mumps meningitis</li>\r\n	<li>B26.2, mumps encephalitis</li>\r\n	<li>B26.3, mumps pancreatitis</li>\r\n	<li>B26.8, mumps with other complications</li>\r\n	<li>B26.9, mumps without complication</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nOne difference you’ll find is an increase in the named complications of mumps. In ICD-9-CM, we have codes for mumps hepatitis, mumps polyneuropathy, and other.\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM specifies these complications:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>B26.81, mumps hepatitis</li>\r\n	<li>B26.82, mumps myocarditis</li>\r\n	<li>B26.83, mumps nephritis</li>\r\n	<li>B26.84, mumps polyneuropathy</li>\r\n	<li>B26.85, mumps arthritis</li>\r\n	<li>B26.89, other mumps complications</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWell, that’s not so bad.\r\n\r\nWhat about whooping cough (also known as pertussis), another reappearing disease?\r\n\r\nIn ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM, we see separate codes for whooping cough due to Bordetella, but ICD-10-CM specifies the type of Bordetella:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>A37.0, whooping cough due to Bordetella pertussis</li>\r\n	<li>A37.1, whooping cough due to Bordetella parapertussis</li>\r\n	<li>A37.8, whooping cough due to other Bordetella species</li>\r\n	<li>A37.9, whooping cough, unspecified species</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nEach of those categories includes two subcategory codes to identify whether the patient has pneumonia as well. In ICD-9-CM, we needed a second code to identify the pneumonia.\r\n\r\nDon’t worry about getting confused on this change. An Excludes1 note (not coded here) under ICD-10-CM category J17 (pneumonia in diseases classified elsewhere) tells us not to use a code from A37 and one from J17 together.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;',

With the root operation Control (third character 3).\r\n\r\nControl (stopping, or attempting to stop, postprocedural bleeding) in ICD-10-PCS represents a very limited set of procedures. You will use root operation Control when the only objective of the procedure is to stop hemorrhaging after a procedure.\r\n\r\nProcedures that fall under Control include:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Irrigating or evacuating a hematoma at the operative site</li>\r\n	<li>Ligation of arterial bleeders</li>\r\n	<li>Cautery with blood clot evacuation</li>\r\n	<li>Drainage at previous operative site to stop bleeding</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe site of the bleeding is coded as an anatomical region and not to a specific body part. For our patient with the post-hysterectomy bleed, we would report 0W3R8ZZ (hysteroscopy with cautery of post-hysterectomy oozing and evacuation of clot).\r\n\r\nOther Control procedures include:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>0X3F0ZZ, open exploration and ligation of post-op arterial bleeder, left forearm</li>\r\n	<li>0W3H0ZZ, control of post-operative retroperitoneal bleeding via laparotomy</li>\r\n	<li>0W3C0ZZ, reopening of thoracotomy site with drainage and control of post-op hemopericardium</li>\r\n	<li>0Y3F4ZZ, arthroscopy with drainage of hemarthrosis at previous operative site, right knee</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWhat happens when the physician needs to perform a more involved procedure to stop the bleeding? For example, a physician needs to resect the spleen in order to control post-procedural bleeding. Do you report a Control procedure, a Resection procedure, or both?\r\n\r\nAccording to ICD-10-PCS guideline B3.7:\r\n\r\n<i>If an attempt to stop post-procedural bleeding is initially unsuccessful, and to stop the bleeding requires performing any of the definitive root operations Bypass, Detachment, Excision, Extraction, Reposition, Replacement, or Resection, then that root operation is coded instead of Control.</i>\r\n\r\nSo for our patient who lost her spleen, we would report 07TP0ZZ (resection of spleen, open approach) or 07TP4ZZ (resection of spleen, percutaneous endoscopic approach).',

Long for an initial visit.\r\n\r\nAfter a thorough exam and some x-rays, Dr. Long diagnoses Peter with a broken right foot. That’s a big foot on that bunny, Dr. Long. Can you be a little more specific?\r\n\r\nActually, we need Dr. Long to be a lot more specific. If we look up Fracture, foot in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index, we find the following choices:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>astragalus—see Fracture, tarsal, talus</li>\r\n	<li>calcaneus—see Fracture, tarsal, calcaneus</li>\r\n	<li>cuboid—see Fracture, tarsal, cuboid</li>\r\n	<li>cuneiform—see Fracture, tarsal, cuneiform</li>\r\n	<li>metatarsal—see Fracture, metatarsal</li>\r\n	<li>navicular—see Fracture, tarsal, navicular</li>\r\n	<li>talus—see Fracture, tarsal, talus</li>\r\n	<li>tarsal—see Fracture, tarsal</li>\r\n	<li>toe—see Fracture, toe</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSo before we can even get to any code, we need to know which bone Peter broke. After consulting the x-rays, Dr. Long documents fractures of the cuboid, lateral cuneiform, and medial cuneiform.\r\n\r\nFor these injuries, we need three different ICD-10-CM codes—one for each bone. We also need to know whether the fractures are displaced or non-displaced and open or closed.\r\n\r\nWe do have some defaults, though, for coding fractures. If the physician does not document displaced or nondisplaced, code it as displaced. If the physician does not document whether the fracture is open or closed, code it as closed.\r\n\r\nWe can use those defaults to code Peter’s fractures as:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S92.211A, displaced fracture of cuboid bone of right foot, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S92.221A, displaced fracture of lateral cuneiform of right foot, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S92.231A, displaced fracture of intermediate cuneiform of right foot, initial encounter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nDr. Long also notices that Peter suffered a dislocated right ankle. That was some hole he hopped into. For an ankle dislocation, we need to know whether the injury is a dislocation or subluxation, laterality, and encounter.\r\n\r\nWe know all of that information—dislocation, right ankle, initial encounter. That gives us ICD-10-CM code S93.04XA, dislocation of right ankle joint.\r\n\r\nNotice that we do need a placeholder X so our seventh character ends up in the seventh spot.\r\n\r\nDr. Long also documented a sprained right ankle. In order to code the sprain, we need to know which specific ligament is involved.\r\n\r\nIn case you are not up on your ankle anatomy, we could be coding for the:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Calcaneofibular ligament</li>\r\n	<li>Deltoid ligament</li>\r\n	<li>Tibiofibular ligament</li>\r\n	<li>Internal collateral ligament</li>\r\n	<li>Talofibular ligament</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe internal collateral and talofibular ligaments are grouped into one code for other ligaments.\r\n\r\nDr. Long thankfully documented that Peter sprained the anterior tibiofibular and calcaneofibular ligaments. That leads us to codes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S93.431A, sprain of tibiofibular ligament of right ankle, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S93.411A, sprain of calcaneofibular ligament of right ankle, initial encounter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nDr. Long puts a cast on Peter’s foot, gives him some crutches, and tells him to avoid hopping on that foot for 6-8 weeks.\r\n\r\nNow it’s time for us to hop on out of the clinic to enjoy a long weekend!',

		'body' : 'Coding for pressure ulcers in ICD-10-CM requires precise documentation of the ulcer’s location, which really shouldn’t surprise anyone. ICD-10-CM includes increased specificity for almost every condition.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Tips.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-3600\" alt=\"Tips\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Tips-300x300.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a>For pressure ulcers, coders need to know laterality for the limbs (e.g., right lower leg, left elbow). For ulcers on the back, the physician should document where on the back the ulcer is (i.e., upper, middle, lower, or presacral).\r\n\r\nThe physician should also document the stage of the ulcer:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Stage I: Intact skin with non-blanchable redness of a localized area, usually over a bony prominence.</li>\r\n	<li>Stage II: Partial thickness loss of dermis presenting as a shallow open ulcer with a red pink wound bed, without slough.</li>\r\n	<li>Stage III: Full thickness tissue loss. Subcutaneous fat may be visible but bone, tendon, or muscle are not exposed.</li>\r\n	<li>Stage IV: Full thickness tissue loss with exposed bone, tendon, or muscle. Slough or eschar may be present on some parts of the wound bed.</li>\r\n	<li>Unstageable: Full thickness tissue loss, in which actual depth of the ulcer is completely obscured by slough (yellow, tan, gray, green, or brown) and/or eschar (tan, brown, or black) in the wound bed.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIf the ulcer can be staged after treatment, the physician should revise the staging.\r\n\r\nWhen you look up ulcer, pressure, in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index, you’ll find the codes listed two different ways:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>By site</li>\r\n	<li>By stage</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIf you look under ulcer, pressure, stage 1, you see a list of all of the possible anatomic sites for a stage 1 pressure ulcer. ICD-10-CM also helpfully includes the description of the stage.\r\n\r\nAnother helpful thing in ICD-10-CM: the guidelines tell us we can use documentation from other clinicians to stage the ulcer. So the nurse can document the ulcer is stage 2 and we can code from that documentation.  We can also code the ulcer as stage 2 if the nurse documents “ulcer with partial thickness skin loss involving the dermis.” We can use either a stage number or the description of the ulcer.\r\n\r\nIf a clinician cannot stage an ulcer at a given time because the bottom cannot be visualized, we can report it as unstageable. For example, if the patient has a pressure ulcer of the left elbow and our provider documents he or she can’t determine the stage, we would report L89.020 (pressure ulcer of left elbow, unstageable).\r\n\r\nHowever, our awesome wound care nurse debrides the ulcer and determines it is a stage 3 pressure ulcer. Going forward we would report L89.023 (pressure ulcer of left elbow, stage 3).\r\n\r\nUnstageable and unspecified are not the same, however. If the clinician simply fails to document a stage, we would report L89.029 (pressure ulcer of left elbow, unspecified stage).',

Stack gave the keynote address at the AHIMA ICD-10 and CAC Summit in Washington today.\r\n\r\nThe AMA wants to kill ICD-10, Stack says, but also did not want Congress to pass another patch to the Sustainable Growth Rate. So the AMA actually pushed for Congress to kill the bill.\r\n\r\nHowever, the AMA remains opposed to ICD-10, Stack says.<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Cadusius.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-3449\" alt=\"Cadusius\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Cadusius-300x300.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a>\r\n\r\nIn some ways, ICD-10 was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Physicians—and the rest of the healthcare industry—have been dealing with so many other mandates that either don’t work as intended or don’t work at all. Stack called EHRs “not ready for prime time” and says Meaningful Use has been overbuilt and is irrational in many ways.\r\n\r\n“We’re all using tools that aren’t quite as good as they should be,” Stack says. Physicians are frustrated by all of the mandates that they’ve been faced with in recent years.\r\n\r\nStack, a practicing ED physician, acknowledges the increased specificity in ICD-10 could provide value, but doesn’t really matter much to the physician at the time he or she is seeing the patient. He used the example of an elderly patient seen in the ED for a hip fracture. ICD-10-CM includes multiple codes that include specific details about the fracture.\r\n\r\n“I know there’s value to that information, but at that point, I don’t really care,” Stack says. “I know the bone is broken, I know it needs surgical treatment, and the patient can’t go home. That’s all I need to know.”\r\n\r\nBased on Stack’s comments, it seems many of the physician frustrations with ICD-10 center on EHRs. “We’re clicking and checking through stuff and not really telling the story we want to tell,” Stack says.\r\n\r\nDuring the question and answer portion of Stack’s presentation, an audience member pointed out that documentation drives coding. She asked how the AMA plans to do great things with diabetes treatment and diagnosis if physicians don’t document the patient’s condition well.\r\n\r\nStack never quite answered the question. “Physicians have an obligation to completely and accurately document,” Stack says. “That doesn’t mean we don’t fail to achieve that obligation.”\r\n\r\nHe added that physicians don’t always document details because they don’t affect clinical judgment.\r\n\r\nThe AHIMA ICD-10 and CAC Summit continues through April 23.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;',

Perform internal testing to make sure that upgrade is working.\r\n\r\n<strong>Follow up with your payers</strong>: Find out if they want to continue testing. If so, take advantage of that additional testing time to make sure claim submission runs smoothly.\r\n\r\n<strong>Revisit your managed care contracts</strong>: If you have contracts that specify October 1, 2014 as the date you will begin submitting ICD-10 codes, check to see whether the contract includes a force majeure clause—meaning parts of the contract don’t apply if the government steps in and changes the ICD-10 implementation date.\r\n\r\n<strong>Complete your EHR implementation</strong>: Reassess which screens require mandatory information. Customize them to include information you will need in ICD-10 but aren’t currently getting. Fix your drop down menus and pick lists. Ask you vendor if it can move the unspecified option to the bottom of the list. Some can, some can’t, but you won’t know if you don’t ask.\r\n\r\nMost importantly: Stay the course.

After the delay, CMS administrators “sliced and diced” the legislation and engaged in robust discussions, Buenning said.\r\n\r\nCMS officials consulted with the Office of General Counsel and the Office of Legislation while crafting the policy with the new implementation date.

It provides an additional year to perform end-to-end testing. CMS is currently scheduled to perform limited end-to-end testing in July, but that date may change.

That’s not a shock. Most of the healthcare industry was ready—or resigned—to October 1, 2014, being the go-live date.</li>\r\n	<li>42% of respondents said their organization has spent more than $1 million on implementation. And that number is only going to increase as implementation gets pushed out even further.</li>\r\n	<li>91% of respondents said ICD-10 should not go into effect in stages. Good thing, too. <b>Denise Buenning, MsM,</b> acting deputy director for CMS’ Office of E-Health Standards and Services, pretty much ruled out a staged implementation during the final session of the conference.</li>\r\n	<li>50% of respondents would – if allowed – be interested in voluntary reporting of ICD-10 codes beginning on Oct. 1 2014. Sadly, they won’t be able to, but everyone should keep practicing ICD-10 coding. Practice, after all, makes perfect and it may help reduce that huge productivity decline we’re expecting once we finally do go live.</li>\r\n	<li>54% of respondents did not want the partial code set freeze lifted. I thought that percentage would be higher. Granted, we haven’t had a significant code update since 2011. Of course, at that point we thought we would be using ICD-10 on October 1, 2013. And now we’re looking at October 1, 2015 (as a best-case scenario). Does it make sense not to add large numbers of new codes for four years? It depends on your point of view. On the pro-freeze side, no new codes means you don’t have to worry about things changing and you can keep learning the new codes. Note however, that the Cooperating Parties have introduced guideline and text changes, as well as a few new codes, so the systems are not completely static. On the no-freeze side, our current ICD-9-CM codes continue to fall short and do you really want to use the same codes for four years with minimal revisions? We’ll have to wait and see where the Cooperating Parties fall on this debate.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nFor the final real-time question, AHIMA asked people to write some thoughts/messages to the rest of the attendees and the HIM world in general on ICD-10. The responses that I saw were overwhelmingly positive and encouraging. And that mentality bodes well for us as we continue down the ICD-10 path.',

You can even get your picture taken with him. Apparently a few too many fans showed up for the photo shoot and Brian is suffering from temporary blindness caused by excessive camera flashes.\r\n\r\nAccording to his chart, Brian suffered from subjective transient vision loss bilaterally. If we look up Blindness, transient, in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index, we are directed to Disturbance, vision, subjective, loss, transient and code H53.12-.\r\n\r\nThat dash tells us we need an additional character. When we head to the Tabular List, we find four codes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>H53.121, transient visual loss, right eye</li>\r\n	<li>H53.122, transient visual loss, left eye</li>\r\n	<li>H53.123, transient visual loss, bilateral</li>\r\n	<li>H53.129, transient visual loss, unspecified eye</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe also find two separate Excludes1 notes. Under subcategory H53.1 (subjective visual disturbances), we find:\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;\">Excludes1:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;\">subjective visual disturbances due to vitamin A deficiency (E50.5)</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;\">visual hallucinations (R44.1)</p>\r\nThat means we cannot report E50.5 or R44.1 with any of the codes in subcategory H53.1.\r\n\r\nUnder H53.12 (transient visual loss) we find Excludes1: amaurosis fugax (G45.3-). Again, we can’t report any code from G45.3- with any code from H53.12-. They are mutually exclusive.\r\n\r\nIf we were using a code from a different subcategory, say H53.13 (sudden visual loss), we could report a code from G45.3-. The Excludes1 note does not apply.\r\n\r\nFortunately for Brian, his condition is temporary and resolves without medical intervention. He just needs to stay away from the mob of camera-wielding fans.\r\n\r\nWe’ll check back with our ACDIS friends as the conference progresses to make sure no one else suffers any mishaps.',

		'body' : 'Today I will focus on the chronological transition to ICD-10 readiness. My intent is to dispel myths and compare real-world experience in the ICD-10 planning space with the commonly disseminated wisdom of the healthcare industry’s coding, compliance and payor advisory bodies. Having said this, let us first discuss the topic of evaluating your organization’s mindset.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Tips.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-3600\" alt=\"Tips\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Tips-300x300.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a>Most conventional wisdom on the topic of ICD-10 planning dives directly into the process of determining impact and creating a current state assessment for use in assembling a complete roadmap toward compliance.\r\n\r\nAlthough basically valid, this approach skips a few crucial steps including the one covered today. Without knowing how your organization sees this behemoth of a transition, you cannot hope to formulate a transition strategy or mitigate any of your risk. This logic applies to both the small group practice as well as the large multi-hospital health system.\r\n\r\nI have observed on various occasions that despite industry pamphlets, project plans, and seminars, many organizations still pigeonhole ICD-10 into the revenue cycle, IT or coding space and isolate the majority of their efforts and governance inside that limited mindset. This is a terminal mistake and will cause drastic repercussions ultimately making well-meaning efforts ineffective.\r\n\r\nThose directors, physicians, or executives that control the multi-year budgeting process must be made aware upfront that the ramification of limiting this process to a single business unit puts the organization’s long term survival in jeopardy. Logically, the case for setting a high priority is easy. Politically or socially this can be one of the hardest steps in getting a project moving forward.\r\n\r\nThe best way to emphasize the importance of the project and gain supporters is to let manager level employees think about the change ramifications that directly affect their areas of responsibility. Effects on people, processes and systems will be drastic in some cases. The objective here is not to cause fear, it is to garner support and inspire action - action you will provide as part of a proactive approach to an impending risk.\r\n\r\nThe pigeonhole mindset is usually the result of the stakeholder or decision maker not seeing the personal ramifications of this transition. If there is no problem to solve combined with a ramification of inaction, you will have no priority.\r\n\r\nOnce the decision maker firmly understands and personalizes the concern, your team can move on to define the scope of the issue.\r\nICD codes are deeply rooting in almost every major business process inside a healthcare entity. They support clinical care, allow for billing, justify adjudication and can be the backbone of compliance. This makes ICD-10 a strategic concern worthy of both human and capital resources.\r\n\r\nChange programs of this magnitude require process, systematic, and training investments that will directly compete with EHR dollars in the present and Accountable Care Organizations and Meaningful Use determination in the future. ICD-10 must take its place beside those strategic issues as a large initiative worthy of high priority.\r\n\r\nYour team will need to instill this mindset in stakeholders like a mantra so that when mundane tasks once again consume their workday you can be assured that this mindset of priority will plant the seed of action.\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Your stakeholders must not only understand the scope of the risk, but also the scope of the solution.</li>\r\n	<li>Can a revenue cycle project upgrade systems or provide awareness training to several thousand front office or inpatient staff?</li>\r\n	<li>Can an IT project change coding processes to maintain coded-per-hour metrics? Can a coding or audit project maintain your standards for days in A/R?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWhen you ask yourself and your stakeholders these types of questions, you begin to realize that an enterprise problem demands an enterprise solution.\r\n\r\nThe mindset variable can be a decisive one. Be sure to focus on stakeholder understanding and support with a clear picture toward future action. If you as the ICD-10 champion can establish personalized stakeholder priority, enterprise risk awareness and enterprise solution support, you have created a strong foundation for the governing structure that is to come.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;',

AHA stopped accepting ICD-9 questions in January.\r\n\r\nCMS also announced plans to cancel its end-to-end testing in July. I’m not particularly surprised by that news and I expect CMS will reschedule testing for a later date. At the AHIMA ICD-10-CM/PCS and Computer-Assisted Coding Summit in Washington, DC, in April, CMS’ Denise Buenning, MsM, acting deputy director for CMS’ Office of E-Health Standards and Services, said the ICD-10 delay would give CMS a more robust pool of healthcare entities to choose for testing.\r\n\r\nShe also offered some insight into CMS’ initial plan not to conduct end-to-end testing. Every quarter, CMS rolls out large system updates, such as the I/OCE updates, average sales prices for drugs, and National Correct Coding Initiative updates. Members of the agency believed that because CMS is able to roll out these updates with few problems, they would be able to switch from ICD-9 to ICD-10 codes without a significant problem. They were viewing the change as just another system update. I’m not sure I completely agree with that logic, but I do understand it.\r\n\r\nCMS is planning to reschedule the testing next year. “Additional opportunities for end-to-end testing will be available in 2015,” CMS announced in a <a href=\"http://www.cms.gov/Outreach-and-Education/Outreach/FFSProvPartProg/Downloads/2014-05-02-enews-file.pdf\">Medicare Learning Network newsletter</a>.',

Not to mention all of the work she put in before the conference.\r\n\r\nDr. Presley diagnoses fatigue. We really need to work on his documentation skills.\r\n\r\nTo code Melissa’s fatigue, we need to know the type. The ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index lists 14 different terms under Fatigue. That doesn’t mean we have 14 different code choices. Four of the terms give us F48.8 (other specified nonpsychotic mental disorders) and two direct us to other conditions.\r\n\r\nGeneral fatigue falls under R53.83 (other fatigue) and includes the terms:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Fatigue NOS</li>\r\n	<li>Lack of energy</li>\r\n	<li>Lethargy</li>\r\n	<li>Tiredness</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nTake a look a little higher up in the Tabular List under R53.8 (other malaise and fatigue). You’ll notice a nice long list of excluded conditions. This is an Excludes1 note, which means you cannot code the two conditions together. One of those excluded conditions is exhaustion and fatigue due to excessive exertion (T73.3).\r\n\r\nSo we need to closely look at Dr. Presley’s documentation to see whether he diagnosed general fatigue or fatigue due to excessive exertion. We may need to query to be sure.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/CatwStomachAche.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-3340\" alt=\"CatwStomachAche\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/CatwStomachAche.jpg\" width=\"193\" height=\"250\" /></a>ACDIS member chick Penny didn’t fare well at the conference either.

We do have a code for intestinal flu, not elsewhere classified (A08.4). However, our CDI friends point out that stomach flu isn’t really the flu at all. It’s gastroenteritis. ICD-10-CM has lots of codes for gastroenteritis, depending on the cause. So we’re going to query Dr. Presley to find out whether he means intestinal flu or gastroenteritis. If it’s gastroenteritis, we need the cause.\r\n\r\nThe gastroenteritis codes fall into two different sections of ICD-10-CM codes, depending on what caused the condition:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>A, certain infectious and parasitic diseases</li>\r\n	<li>K, diseases of the digestive system</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIn Penny’s case, Dr. Presley documents gastroenteritis due to norovirus, which leads us to A08.11 (acute gastroenteropathy due to Norwalk agent).\r\n\r\nI think I’ll skip the buffet the next time I’m in Vegas.',

He is complaining of pain in his right forearm with some mild swelling and tenderness. Poor Steven has tendonitis due to overuse of his wrist and forearm.\r\n\r\nWhen we look up tendonitis in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index, we find a list of possible sites and types. We also find a note under tendonitis due to use, overuse, and pressure—<i>see also</i> Disorder, soft tissue, due to use. Since we don’t have any listing for forearm under tendonitis, let’s see what we can find under Disorder.\r\n\r\nBingo! We find code M70.93-. The dash tells us the code is incomplete, so we head to the Tabular List to find the missing character(s). As an aside, you should always check your code in the Tabular List. Not all codes that need additional characters have dashes.\r\n\r\nBecause we know Steven’s pain is in his right forearm, we will report M70.831 (other soft tissue disorders related to use, overuse and pressure, right forearm).\r\n\r\nWe can also add some external cause codes for Steven:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Y93.89, activity, other specified (sadly we have no code for throwing dice or gambling)</li>\r\n	<li>Y92.59, other trade areas as the place of occurrence of the external cause (casino)</li>\r\n	<li>Y99.8, other external cause status (leisure activity)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nOn the bright side, he came out ahead at the tables.\r\n\r\nDavid, one of our marketing friends who worked the conference, decided to take in a show while he was in Vegas. Apparently, he got a little too close to the stage and was kicked in the head by a showgirl (For the record, David claims the showgirls came down among the audience.)\r\n\r\nDavid sustained a hematoma to his forehead from the showgirl’s shoe. He also suffered a scratched cornea caused by a feather in the showgirl’s costume.\r\n\r\nWhen we look up hematoma in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index, we find a lot of possible sites, but the forehead isn’t one of them.\r\n\r\nA hematoma is a localized collection of blood, usually clotted, in an organ, space, or tissue, due to a break in the wall of a blood vessel, according to <i>Dorland’s Medical Dictionary</i>. A contusion (bruise) is a superficial injury produced by impact without laceration.\r\n\r\nWe don’t have a code for a hematoma of the forehead, and since David suffered a hematoma, we would not use a code for a contusion. That leaves us with S09.8- (other specified injuries of head). If David was seeing a physician, we would need to know the encounter (initial, subsequent, or sequela) in order to add the correct seventh character (after two X placeholders, of course).\r\n\r\nDavid’s corneal abrasion is a little more straightforward. We need to know which eye was involved (the left) and the encounter. For a corneal abrasion of the left eye (without a foreign body) we would report S05.02- with a placeholder X and the appropriate seventh character.\r\n\r\nOur final member of the ACDIS injury list is Wendy, who stayed an extra day in Las Vegas to enjoy the beauty of the desert. Unfortunately, Wendy forgot to pack enough water and ended up with heat exhaustion.\r\n\r\nYou can look up either heat or exhaustion in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index and you will end up at the same place: T67.- (heat stroke and sunstroke). We have three possible codes for Wendy’s condition:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>T67.3-, heat exhaustion, anhidrotic (heat prostration due to water depletion)</li>\r\n	<li>T67.4-, heat exhaustion due to salt depletion (heat prostration due to salt [and water] depletion)</li>\r\n	<li>T67.5-, heat exhaustion, unspecified</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nUnder T67.3-, we find an Excludes1 note for heat exhaustion due to salt depletion (T67.4-). So those two codes can’t be reported together.\r\n\r\nWe again need two placeholders and a seventh character for Wendy’s heat stroke. Thankfully she is on the mend and we can close the books on the Vegas convention. Next year, San Antonio!',

		'body' : 'Recently I have seen many articles casting a negative outlook on ICD-10. They scare everyone into believing that added specificity to the codes will create more work for everyone, especially the physicians as we rely on their documentation. Many have focused on some of the less important aspects of ICD-10, like the added specificity to external cause codes.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I would like to point out a big change between ICD-9 and ICD-10 that could impact providers (especially physician practices) and help payers create policies and understandings of a patient’s encounter.<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Tips.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-3600\" alt=\"Tips\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Tips-300x300.jpg\" width=\"237\" height=\"237\" /></a>\r\n\r\nEach year patients go to their physicians for annual physicals. Currently, we have V codes to identify the physical is the reason for encounter. For example, a 28-year old female presents for her annual physical. The physician assigns code V70.0.\r\n\r\nAccording to <i>Official ICD-9-CM Guidelines for Coding and Reporting</i>, if a diagnosis or condition is discovered during the encounter, coders should report additional code(s) to indicate the findings.\r\n\r\nFor example, if a physician discovered a breast mass he or she would report ICD-9-CM code 611.72 (lump or mass in breast) since he or she will provide additional services to evaluate/treat the condition.\r\n\r\nWhen this is submitted to the payer, how does that payer know what transpired during the encounter? How do they know whether the patient came in for the annual exam and had an incidental finding of a breast mass  or whether the patient’s intent was to be seen for the breast mass and while she were there the physician noted she hadn’t had her annual exam? When coding cannot give a true picture of the encounter in cases like this, the payer may hold up reimbursement and cost us all time and money while we sort it out.\r\n\r\nIn ICD-10-CM, some routine examination codes distinguish between ‘with’ and ‘without’ abnormal findings. Additional code(s) should be assigned to identify the specific abnormal finding. Therefore, if a28-year old female presents for her annual physical and the physician discovers a breast mass, we will report:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Z00.01, encounter for general adult medical examination with abnormal findings</li>\r\n	<li>N63, unspecified lump in breast</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThis will provide the payer with a ‘true’ picture of the encounter and therefore potentially decrease the time and money that we spend on regular routine care.',

She packed plenty of water, munchies, and books to read, but didn’t pack her sunscreen. As a result, she ended up with a nasty sunburn.\r\n\r\nThe only information we really need to code Jackee’s sunburn is the degree:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>L55.0, sunburn of first degree</li>\r\n	<li>L55.1, sunburn of second degree</li>\r\n	<li>L55.2, sunburn of third degree</li>\r\n	<li>L55.9, sunburn, unspecified</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe physician does need to specify the degree; you can’t just guess or default to first degree.\r\n\r\nWe can also add some External Cause codes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>X32.XXXA, exposure to sunlight, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>Y92.832, beach as the place of occurrence of the external cause</li>\r\n	<li>Y99.8, other external cause status</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nGina also headed to the beach for the weekend, but she was a little less prepared than Jackee. Gina forgot to pack her water but spent the day anyway. She came into the clinic complaining of nausea, vomiting, vertigo, and muscle cramps. Her temperature was 104°F and her heartbeat was fast and weak.\r\n\r\nDr. Sunni Daze diagnosis sunstroke. That’s pretty easy to code. We have one choice: T67.0 (heatstroke and sunstroke).\r\n\r\nHowever, we do see a note to use additional code(s) to identify any associated complications of heatstroke, such as:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>coma and stupor (R40.-)</li>\r\n	<li>systemic inflammatory response syndrome (R65.1-)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSince Dr. Daze didn’t document any complications, we don’t need to report any additional diagnosis codes. We could report the same External Cause codes as we did for Jackee.\r\n\r\nOur final post-Memorial Day patient skipped the beach and went camping instead. That also turned out to be a less-than-perfect way to spend the weekend.\r\n\r\nGeoff ran afoul of some ticks in the woods, who decided to tag along for his ride home. They also left him with what he thought was a summer cold. Instead, he contracted Lyme disease.\r\n\r\nWe have five codes for Lyme disease, depending on what condition results from the disease:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>A69.20, Lyme disease, unspecified</li>\r\n	<li>A69.21, meningitis due to Lyme disease</li>\r\n	<li>A69.22, other neurologic disorders in Lyme disease</li>\r\n	<li>A69.23, arthritis due to Lyme disease</li>\r\n	<li>A69.29, other conditions associated with Lyme disease</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe can still assign External Cause codes for Geoff’s illness. One thing to watch out for is the first code. You may be tempted to assign a code for bitten by an insect. However, ticks are not actually insects. They are arthropods, like spiders. It turns out that we will still report W57.XXXA (bitten or stung by nonvenomous insect and other nonvenomous arthropods) because ICD-10-CM lumps insects and arthropods into one code.\r\n\r\nOur additional External Cause codes would be:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Y92.821, forest as the place of occurrence of the external cause</li>\r\n	<li>Y93.01, activity, walking, marching and hiking (camping doesn’t have its own code, but Geoff was also hiking during his trip)</li>\r\n	<li>Y99.8, other external cause status</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSo when you head out this summer remember your sunscreen, drink plenty of water, and watch out for small arthropods.',

It’s not the volume of the documentation. It’s the actual content of what the provider puts in the record.\r\n\r\nFor example, Eric is a diabetic patient with peripheral neuropathy. Dr. Jones documents “diabetes” in Eric’s medical record. In ICD-10-CM, we would default to E11.9 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, that code doesn’t really reflect Eric’s severity of illness. The code description states “without complications,” but Eric in fact does suffer from a diabetic complication. The physician didn’t document it, so we can’t code it.\r\n\r\nIf you work in an outpatient setting, E11.9 alone probably won’t support a high-level visit CPT code. And it’s definitely not going to support medical necessity for an inpatient admission.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the physician documents “Type 2 diabetic with peripheral neuropathy,” we can report E11.43 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic autonomic [poly[neuropathy). The physician added five words, but we coded a much more specific diagnosis.\r\n\r\nIf you have an EHR, find out whether you can add prompts to the system to require additional information. If the physician chooses “diabetes” from a drop-down menu, can you add a submenu that requires the physician to specify Type 1 or Type 2? Can you add a prompt asking if the patient has any associated conditions (such as renal failure) or other complications?\r\n\r\nMaybe you can, maybe you can’t. It doesn’t hurt to ask.\r\n\r\nWe’re not asking physicians to write <i>War and Peace</i> for every patient (although some patients may require extensive documentation). The content of the documentation, the actual clinical information the physician uses, is much more important than volume of the documentation. If the physician writes an 18-page progress note for an inpatient with a diabetic foot ulcer, but doesn’t connect the diabetes to the ulcer or provide any information about the stage and site, you’re stuck reporting less specific codes.\r\n\r\nBetter documentation will benefit physicians and coders now and after the ICD-10 transition. Look for ways to help your physicians document better to make your own transition easier. Ambiguous, incomplete, or unclear documentation makes the coder’s job harder. The better the physician documentation, the easier it is to assign the correct code.\r\n\r\nUse the extra time between now and ICD-10 implementation to convince your physicians of the value of better, clearer, concise documentation.',

Apparently Damian saw a black cat on the stoop outside his apartment and tried to pick it up and move it so his elderly neighbor wouldn’t trip. Said cat was happy where it was and scratched Damian repeatedly when he tried to evict it. That explains the lacerations.\r\n\r\nIn order to code them, we need to know the specific locations and whether any foreign body remains in the laceration. If the lacerations are to Damian’s fingers, we also need to know whether the nails are damaged as well.\r\n\r\nSo if Damian suffered lacerations on his right index, middle, and ring fingers with no foreign bodies or nail damage, we would report:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S61.210A, laceration without foreign body of right index finger without damage to nail, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S61.212A, laceration without foreign body of right middle finger without damage to nail, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S61.214A, laceration without foreign body of right ring finger without damage to nail, initial encounter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nEach finger gets its own code and you could have some fingers with nail damage and/or foreign bodies remaining in the wound. Make sure you read the documentation closely to find these details.\r\n\r\nWhat about Damian’s hives? It turns out he is allergic to cats (but didn’t know it) and the hives are a reaction to the cat dander. Dr. Scratchy documents contact dermatitis due to an allergic reaction to cats.\r\n\r\nIn the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index, we look up dermatitis, contact, allergic, and we find an entry for dander (cat) (dog). The index lists the code as L23.81 with no dashes indicating extra characters are needed. However, because we are expert coders, we check the Tabular List just to be sure. Turns out we don’t need any additional characters, so L23.81 it is.\r\n\r\nWe can also add some external cause codes if our payer wants them:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>W55.09XA, other contact with cat, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>Y92.038, other place in apartment as the place of occurrence of the external cause</li>\r\n	<li>Y99.8, other external cause status</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nOur second patient, Gabriel, walked under a ladder on the sidewalk and was hit on the head by a falling paint can. The blow caused a small skull fracture.\r\n\r\nFor the skull fracture, we need to know the bone(s) involved and whether it is open or closed. As an aside, we don’t need to know whether a skull fracture is displaced.\r\n\r\nWhen we look under category S02 (fracture of the skull and facial bones) we find the following note:\r\n\r\nCode also any associated intracranial injury (S06.-)\r\n\r\nSo that’s another piece of information we need.\r\n\r\nLet’s check out Dr. Scratchy documentation and see what we can find:\r\n\r\n<i>Patient struck on head with paint can, suffered closed fracture of parietal bone, subdural hematoma noted on x-ray. Patient also suffered concussion with LOC of 14 minutes. Initial visit for injuries. </i>\r\n\r\nWith that information, we can report:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S02.0XXA, fracture of vault of skull, initial encounter (notice that we need two placeholder Xs)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIf we look up hematoma, subdural (traumatic), in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index, we are directed to injury, intracranial, subdural hemorrhage. That leads us to code subcategory S06.5X-. This subcategory of codes is broken down to include a time element. For Gabriel, who lost consciousness for 14 minutes, we would report:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S06.5X1A, traumatic subdural hemorrhage with loss of consciousness of 30 minutes or less, initial encounter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou have to go all the way back to the beginning of category S06 (intracranial injury) to find out that you need a seventh character. We currently do the same thing in ICD-9-CM, so you should be used to looking for those additional character notations.\r\n\r\nAgain, we can add some external cause codes if our payer wants them:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>W20.8XXA, other cause of strike by thrown, projected, or falling object, initial encounter (the paint can)</li>\r\n	<li>Y93.01, activity, walking, marching and hiking</li>\r\n	<li>Y92.480, sidewalk as the place of occurrence of the external cause</li>\r\n	<li>Y99.8, other external cause status</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nOur final patient, Marion, was talking on her cell phone while walking in the mall when she suddenly lost service. (Apparently the full moon is playing havoc with communications.) As she was trying to reconnect her call, she failed to pay proper attention to where she was going and she walked into a department store mannequin. The mannequin was unable to maintain its balance and toppled onto Marion.\r\n\r\nMarion suffered a concussion and a bruised cheek in the scuffle (she maintains that the mannequin started it). She also experienced a severe panic attack (which is also apparently the mannequin’s fault).\r\n\r\nThe first thing we need to know is whether Marion suffered any loss of consciousness. Dr. Scratchy notes a brief LOC of less than five minutes. We also need to know which cheek was contused. Dr. Scratchy says left.\r\n\r\nThat gives us codes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S06.0X1A, concussion with loss of consciousness of 30 minutes or less, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S00.83XA, contusion of other part of head, initial encounter (the cheek does not have its own specified body part)</li>\r\n	<li>F41.0, panic disorder [episodic paroxysmal anxiety] without agoraphobia (panic attack)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe run into a small dilemma when it comes to our external cause codes. Marion walked into a stationary object, which then fell on her. W22.8XXA (striking against or struck by other objects) is probably our best bet.\r\n\r\nWe can also add:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Y93.C2, activity, hand held interactive electronic device (I choose this one because she was distracted by her phone)</li>\r\n	<li>Y92.513, shop (commercial) as the place of occurrence of the external cause (because she was in a store when she fell afoul of the mannequin)</li>\r\n	<li>Y99.8, other external cause status</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nHow much longer until Saturday?',

Even master ball dodgers can end up in the Fix ‘Em Up Clinic.\r\n\r\nSteve engaged in a spirited game of dodge ball over the weekend, which resulted in him coming in to see Dr. Howard T. Duck.\r\n\r\nSteve planted his foot to pivot out of the way of the speeding ball and heard a pop in his knee, followed by excruciating pain. He thought he sprained his knee and was prepared to shake off the injury with some rest and ic<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Dodgeball-kid.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-3960\" alt=\"Dodgeball kid\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Dodgeball-kid-300x211.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"211\" /></a>e. Sadly, this morning his knee locked up, thus convincing him of the need to come to the clinic.\r\n\r\nDr. Duck performs some preliminary tests and sends Steve for an MRI. After reviewing the results, Dr. Duck has to break some bad news to Steve: he has osteochondritis dissecans of the knee.\r\n\r\nWhat is osteochondritis dissecans, you ask. It’s a joint condition in which a piece of cartilage, along with a thin layer of the bone beneath it, comes loose from the end of a bone. In some people, the fracture heals with no problem. For other people, like poor Steve, the piece of bone comes loose and gets stuck in the moving parts of the joint.\r\n\r\nHow would we code Steve’s injury? As a fracture since a piece of his kneecap came off? Or as something else?\r\n\r\nIf you look in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index, you will find osteochondritis has its own index entry, which includes multiple subterms, such as Brailsford’s, dissecans, juvenile, and syphilitic.\r\n\r\nWe know Steve has osteochondritis dissecans, which is further divided by site. We know the site is the knee, which leads us to M93.26-.\r\n\r\nThe dash tells us we need more characters in our code. I’m guessing we’ll need laterality. Off to the Tabular List we go to find that we have three choices:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>M93.261, osteochondritis dissecans, right knee</li>\r\n	<li>M93.262, osteochondritis dissecans, left knee</li>\r\n	<li>M93.269, osteochondritis dissecans, unspecified knee</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nNotice that we don’t need a seventh character to denote the encounter. That’s because osteochondritis dissecans does not fall under chapter 19 (injury, poisonings, and other complications of external causes). It’s considered a disease of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue.\r\n\r\nIf you are like me and you want to know why, it’s because Dr. Duck and his colleagues in the medical profession aren’t completely sure what causes osteochondritis dissecans. Potential causes include:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>A reduction of blood flow to the end of the affected bone</li>\r\n	<li>Repetitive trauma—small, multiple episodes of minor unrecognized injury that damage the end of the affected bone</li>\r\n	<li>A possible genetic component, making some people more inclined to develop the disorder</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThey do know that younger males involved in sports are more likely to develop the condition and it also increases their risk of developing osteoarthritis down the road. We’ll have to keep tabs on Steve to see how he’s doing down the road.',

He tells Nurse Nosey that he smokes a pack of cigarettes a day and has for the past 20 years.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/shutterstock_73841773.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-3965\" alt=\"shutterstock_73841773\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/shutterstock_73841773-213x300.jpg\" width=\"213\" height=\"300\" /></a> After examining Jeff, Dr. Sniffle diagnoses chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He also notes that Jeff is a smoker. No wonder Jeff has trouble breathing.\r\n\r\nWhen we look up COPD in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index (under disease, pulmonary, chronic), we are directed to the J44 (other chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) code series. We find lots of interesting notes under J44. We have Includes, Excludes1, Code also, and Use additional code notes.\r\n\r\nWe’re going to just look at the Use additional code notes.\r\n\r\nUse additional code to identify:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (Z77.22)</li>\r\n	<li>history of tobacco use (Z87.891)</li>\r\n	<li>occupational exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (Z57.31)</li>\r\n	<li>tobacco dependence (F17.-)</li>\r\n	<li>tobacco use (Z72.0)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe know Jeff is a smoker, but which additional code should we use? Dr. Sniffle didn’t document dependence, use, or abuse, just that Jeff was a smoker.\r\n\r\nThe ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index to the rescue! If you look up smoker in the index, you are directed to see dependence, drug, nicotine. It doesn’t matter how much Jeff smokes, just that he is a smoker, according to Nelly Leon-Chisen, RHIA, director of coding and classification for the American Hospital Association in Chicago.\r\n\r\nWhat does matter is whether Dr. Sniffle documents a link between Jeff’s smoking and his COPD. If Dr. Sniffle notes that Jeff’s smoking caused his COPD, we would report:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>J44.9, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, unspecified</li>\r\n	<li>F17.218, nicotine dependence, cigarettes, with other nicotine-induced disorders</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nHowever, if Dr. Sniffle does not document a link between Jeff’s smoking and COPD, we cannot assume one (<i>Coding Clinic</i>, Fourth Quarter 2013, p. 109). That changes our codes to:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>J44.9, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, unspecified</li>\r\n	<li>F17.210, nicotine dependence, cigarettes, uncomplicated</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe main cause of COPD is smoking (according to WebMD and the Mayo Clinic). Even so, we can’t assume the connection. Jeff’s COPD could possibly be caused by something else. If you aren’t sure, drop Dr. Sniffle a query and ask whether he can specify the cause of Jeff’s COPD.',

It started out well as he spent Sunday with his folks and older brother at an amusement park being as amused as a 6-month-old can be.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/crying-baby-e1340392061749.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-2827\" alt=\"crying baby\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/crying-baby-300x253.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"253\" /></a>Things started going downhill Monday when mom Melissa had to wipe off a thick yellow discharge crusting over Finn’s eyelashes when she woke him up. She also noticed the whites of Finn’s eyes were now red.\r\n\r\nShe brought Finn into the Fix ‘Em Up Clinic to see Dr. Spock, who diagnosed bilateral acute bacterial conjunctivitis and prescribes eye drops. Dr. Spock expects Finn to be on the mend soon.\r\n\r\nWhen we look up conjunctivitis, acute, we find choices for:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Atopic</li>\r\n	<li>Chemical</li>\r\n	<li>Mucopurulent</li>\r\n	<li>Pseudomembranous</li>\r\n	<li>Serous except viral</li>\r\n	<li>Toxic</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWhich one do we use? Since we are super coders, we know bacterial conjunctivitis falls under serous not viral, which takes us to code H10.23-. Ah, the dash. That tells us we need more characters for our code.\r\n\r\nWhen we visit the Tabular List, we find the additional character we need identifies laterality. Dr. Spock documented bilateral, so we would use H10.233 (serous conjunctivitis, except viral, bilateral).\r\n\r\nOff Finn went with some eye drops and antibiotics and things should have ended well enough there.\r\n\r\nFinn was back at the Clinic Thursday for his six-month well baby checkup. Right off the bat, we know our first code with be one of these:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Z00.121, encounter for routine child health examination with abnormal findings</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\">Use additional code to identify abnormal findings</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Z00.129, encounter for routine child health examination without abnormal findings</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIn order to choose, we need to know if Dr. Spock found anything wrong with Finn (other than the previously diagnoses pinkeye). Sadly for Finn, Dr. Spock also identified an ear infection. That means we’re going with Z00.121. We also need to add additional codes to report what’s wrong with Finn.\r\n\r\nTo code his ear infection, we need to know:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Where is the infection—outer, middle, or inner ear?</li>\r\n	<li>Which side (or both)?</li>\r\n	<li>Acute or chronic?</li>\r\n	<li>Suppurative or nonsuppurative?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nLet’s see what Dr. Spock documented. As we scan through the documentation, we see:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Acute</li>\r\n	<li>Nonsuppurative</li>\r\n	<li>Bilateral</li>\r\n	<li>Secretory otitis media</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWith that information, we can report code H65.03 (acute serous otitis media, bilateral).\r\n\r\nWe also see two notes under H65, Nonsuppurative otitis media:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Use additional code for any associated perforated tympanic membrane (H72.-)</li>\r\n	<li>Use additional code to identify:</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\">exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (Z77.22)</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\">exposure to tobacco smoke in the perinatal period (P96.81)</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\">history of tobacco use (Z87.891)</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\">occupational exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (Z57.31)</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\">tobacco dependence (F17.-)</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\">tobacco use (Z72.0)</p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nDr. Spock did not document any tobacco exposure or a perforated ear drum, so we don’t need any additional codes.\r\n\r\nHowever, when we continue reading the office visit note, we find that Finn received four vaccinations:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>DTaP</li>\r\n	<li>Hib</li>\r\n	<li>PCV</li>\r\n	<li>Rota</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWhen we look up vaccination in the Alphabetic Index, we find codes for\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Complication or reaction</li>\r\n	<li>Delayed</li>\r\n	<li>Encounter for</li>\r\n	<li>Not done</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe already have an encounter code for the well baby visit. Do we still code an encounter for the vaccinations? Yes. In fact, when we look up code Z23 (encounter for immunization), ICD-10-CM tells use to code first any routine childhood examination. Not only do we know we need both codes, but we even get the sequencing.\r\n\r\nOne other thing to note under Z23:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Note: procedure codes are required to identify the types of immunizations given</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSo don’t forget your CPT codes for vaccine administration and HCPCS codes for the specific vaccines.\r\n\r\nHopefully, Finn will be feeling better soon!',

Take, for example, Jean-Baptiste Lully, King Louis XIV’s favorite and main court composer. In January 1687, Lully inadvertently struck his foot with the pointed staff he had been using to keep time while conducting his Te Deum for Louis.\r\n\r\nHealthcare being what it was in the 17<sup>th</sup> century, Lully developed gangrene. He refused to have the foot amputated (no super antibiotics in those days) and subsequently died.\r\n\r\nSince we don’t have an exact cause of death (my guess is septic shock), let’s code his gangrene instead.\r\n\r\nWhen we look up gangrene in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index, we see a nice long list of potential codes, some of which specify a type and some that specify location. For example, we would use K35.80 for gangrene of the appendix. For gas gangrene, we would report A48.0.\r\n\r\nMany of the terms direct you to other terms. For example, gangrene with diabetes directs you to see Diabetes, gangrene.\r\n\r\nWe know Lully’s gangrene started in his foot (although we don’t know which one). Foot is not one of our choices for a gangrene location, but we do have extremities. The foot counts as an extremity and both upper and lower extremities lead to the same code: I96 (gangrene, not elsewhere classified).\r\n\r\nThat’s a nice vague code, but it is not an unspecified code. It’s a NOC code—we have the information, we just don’t have a more specific code. It’s worth noting that I96 includes a long list of Exclude1 codes (meaning don’t code together):\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Gangrene in atherosclerosis of native arteries of the extremities (I70.26)</li>\r\n	<li>Gangrene in diabetes mellitus (E08-E13)</li>\r\n	<li>Gangrene in hernia (K40.1, K40.4, K41.1, K41.4, K42.1, K43.1-, K44.1, K45.1, K46.1)</li>\r\n	<li>Gangrene in other peripheral vascular diseases (I73.-)</li>\r\n	<li>Gangrene of certain specified sites - see Alphabetical Index</li>\r\n	<li>Gas gangrene (A48.0)</li>\r\n	<li>Pyoderma gangrenosum (L88)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAcne appears to have done in Alexander Scriabin. The Russian composer-pianist noticed a pimple on his upper lip, which became infected. The infection progressed to a fatal case of septicemia.\r\n\r\nAh, septicemia, one of the problem children of the coding world (largely because doctors don’t document it well). In ICD-9-CM, our septicemia choices include:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>038.0, streptococcal septicemia</li>\r\n	<li>038.1x, staphylococcal septicemia</li>\r\n	<li>038.2, pneumococcal septicemia [Streptococcus pneumoniae septicemia]</li>\r\n	<li>038.3, septicemia due to anaerobes</li>\r\n	<li>038.4x, septicemia due to other gram-negative organisms</li>\r\n	<li>038.8, other specified septicemias</li>\r\n	<li>038.9, unspecified septicemia</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIn ICD-10-CM, we have no codes for septicemia. Huh?\r\n\r\nIn ICD-10-CM, we will not have codes with septicemia in the code title but will code it as sepsis since it is the body’s systemic reaction to infection.\r\n\r\nIf you look up septicemia in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index, you find one code—A41.9 (Sepsis, unspecified organism)—and a note: meaning sepsis—see Sepsis.\r\n\r\nWe should not be at a loss for options when it comes to sepsis. ICD-10-CM includes codes for\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Anaerobic A41.4</li>\r\n	<li>Bacillus anthracis A22.7</li>\r\n	<li>Brucella (see also Brucellosis) A23.9</li>\r\n	<li>Candidal B37.7</li>\r\n	<li>Cryptogenic A41.9</li>\r\n	<li>Due to device, implant or graft T85.79</li>\r\n	<li>Enterococcus A41.81</li>\r\n	<li>Erysipelothrix (rhusiopathiae) (erysipeloid) A26.7</li>\r\n	<li>Escherichia coli (E. coli) A41.5</li>\r\n	<li>Extraintestinal yersiniosis A28.2</li>\r\n	<li>Gangrenous A41.9</li>\r\n	<li>Gonococcal A54.86</li>\r\n	<li>Gram-negative (organism) A41.5</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAnd so on and so forth. What we really need is for the physician to specify the causative organism. Otherwise, we’re back to A41.9. Before you prepare to bombard your physicians with a bazillion queries for causative organisms, take a look at ICD-10-CM guideline B18:\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><i>When sufficient clinical information isn’t known or available about a particular health condition to assign a more specific code, it is acceptable to report the appropriate “unspecified” code (e.g., a diagnosis of pneumonia has been determined, but not the specific type).</i></p>\r\nThe guideline goes on to state:\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><i>It would be inappropriate to select a specific code that is not supported by the medical record documentation or conduct medically unnecessary diagnostic testing in order to determine a more specific code.</i></p>\r\nConsider carefully whether the physician can provide additional details before you send that query. If you see that Dr. Germ wrote an order for a lab test that should provide the information, by all means, politely ask him or her to provide details.\r\n\r\nOur final musically inclined casualty is something of a mystery (or a conspiracy, depending on who you believe). Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, who composed the perennial Christmas classic The Nutcracker, died of either cholera or suicide.\r\n\r\nCholera is Tchaikovsky’s official cause of death. Witnesses, including his brother, said Tchaikovsky drank a glass of unboiled water during a cholera outbreak in St. Petersburg.\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM includes three codes for cholera, and they are actually the first three codes in the Tabular List:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>A00.0, cholera due to Vibrio cholerae 01, biovar cholerae</li>\r\n	<li>A00.1, cholera due to Vibrio cholerae 01, biovar eltor</li>\r\n	<li>A00.9, cholera, unspecified</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIf we know the causative organism, we’ll go with a specific code. If our physician doesn’t document it, we’ll go with A00.9.',

Of the respondents, 27.5% worked in acute care hospitals with an equal number working in clinics and physician practices.\r\n\r\nThe results of the survey show both concern and optimism.\r\n\r\nFirst the not-so-good view. A little more than one-third of respondents (38%) believe revenue will decrease in the first year of ICD-10. Only 6% believe revenue will go up and 14% think it will stay the same. More than a quarter of respondents (26%) haven’t done any financial projections.\r\n\r\nThe majority of respondents (61%) believe coding patient encounters will be harder immediately after implementation, which makes sense and fits with the coder productivity declines seen in other countries.\r\n\r\nForty-four percent said documentation will be more difficult. I’m not sure what to think about that aspect of the transition. Coders and CDI specialists will tell you physicians don’t document well in ICD-9. The diseases aren’t changing, but the documentation requirements for many are. I suspect we will see plenty of additional documentation shortcomings in ICD-10.\r\n\r\nThat’s not to throw physicians under the bus and blame them. We need to educate them on what we need to see in the documentation. They’re taught to document for other physicians.

Forty-one percent of respondents think coding will be more accurate in the long term (although they don’t specify what “long term” is).\r\n\r\nQuality of care will improve, according to 27% of respondents, and 25% believe patient safety will improve.\r\n\r\nRespondents believe the increased specificity will help improve research, population health management, and quality and performance measurement in the long term.\r\n\r\nA whopping 68% of the respondents are planning additional training during the delay, which sounds like a wonderful idea. The better coders, CDIs, and physicians understand the requirements of ICD-10, the sooner we will realize the long-term benefits.',

		'body' : 'CMS and Obamacare have increasingly been moving healthcare toward a more value-based model. They want to pay physicians for how well they treat patients and not by the volume of services they provide. Even outpatient hospital services are moving that way as CMS increasingly packages services into one payment.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Tips.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-3600\" alt=\"Tips\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Tips-300x300.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a>What happens when ICD-10 enters this value-focused mix? Imagine how much information physicians and coders can’t capture today because we just don’t have the codes to represent the true clinical picture of the patient’s illness.\r\n\r\nFor example, in ICD-9, we have no way of knowing whether a patient broke his or her right or left arm. We can code for the specific bone (radius or ulna) and the area of the bone (upper end, shaft, or lower end). We can even specify open or closed.\r\n\r\nWhat we can’t tell is which side. Why does that matter? Well, consider this scenario. George comes in with a closed fracture of the distal end of the radius (In ICD-9-CM, you would use code 813.43. In ICD-10-CM, we would use a code from the S52.5- series, but we need a lot more information to select the most specific code).\r\n\r\nDr. Bones treats George and sends him on his way. Unfortunately for George, he is back in three weeks with another fracture. Suppose Dr. Bones documents a closed fracture of the distal end of the radius, our 813.43 ICD-9-CM code again. Do you think our payer might be a little suspicious about that?\r\n\r\nHowever, in ICD-10-CM, you could show that George broke the right radius first, then was unlucky enough to break the left one. We’ll have separate codes for each fracture. For example, if George suffered a displaced oblique fracture of the shaft of the right radius, we would report S52.331A for the initial encounter.\r\n\r\nWhen Dr. Bones sees him for the left radial fracture, she documents a nondisplaced comminuted fracture of the shaft of the radius of the left arm (S52.355A). Two different injuries, two different codes.\r\n\r\nWe’ll also be able to track how well an injury is healing. ICD-10-CM includes seventh characters that specify the encounter. The three most common are:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>A, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>D, subsequent encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S, sequela</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThose choices expand for fractures that include:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>D, routine healing</li>\r\n	<li>G, delayed healing</li>\r\n	<li>K, nonunion</li>\r\n	<li>P, malunion</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe main code will stay the same; the seventh character will tell you how well the fracture is healing. Suppose George’s right arm fracture was showing malunion when he came in for the initial treatment of the left arm fracture. We could report two codes for that visit and those codes will tell our payer that Dr. Bones treated two separate injuries on that day. If you’re wondering, the codes would be S52.331P and S52.355A.\r\n\r\nNotice that the code for the malunion is almost exactly the same as the code for the initial visit for the right arm fracture. In ICD-10-CM that fracture code will run through the entire course of treatment for the injury. That will make it easier to pull data about how well a treatment works, how a patient responds to a particular treatment, and what the physician does to treat that particular injury over the course of healing.\r\n\r\nAnd all of that leads us back to quality measures. If you see a patient who suffers a lot of fractures, the physician should look for an underlying reason. Is George clumsy? Does he work in a high-risk environment? Does he have another condition that makes him more susceptible to fractures?\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if George keeps coming in for treatment of the same fracture over and over, maybe Dr. Bones isn’t doing a good job.\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM will make it easier to figure that out because we will have more granular data and we’ll actually be able to tell (to some extent) what quality of treatment a physician is providing.\r\n\r\n“We can’t pay for value if we don’t know the outcomes and what the value of the treatment really is,” says <b>Sue Bowman, MJ, RHIA, CCS, FAHIMA</b>, senior director of coding policy and compliance for AHIMA in Chicago.\r\n\r\n“ICD-10 will really help give us more specific data, so we can see what the outcomes really are and we can judge what is good value.”',

Alternately, you can Google “Gray’s anatomy illustrations.” They are in the public domain. Some of them are pretty good, especially considering it was first published in 1858.<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/image505.gif\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-3983\" alt=\"image505\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/image505-193x300.gif\" width=\"193\" height=\"300\" /></a>\r\n\r\nNot surprisingly, anatomy hasn’t really changed since then. Our understanding of certain things--like what parts of the brain are involved in which functions—has changed, but the structures themselves have stayed the same for the last many thousands of years.\r\n\r\nSo why do you need to brush up on anatomy and physiology before ICD-10? The best reason I’ve heard so far comes from <b>Gerri Walk, RHIA, CCS</b>, senior manager of technical training for HRS in Baltimore.\r\n\r\n“The vessels of the heart are like roads in Texas,” Gerri says. “Turn a corner and you’re on a different road or in a different vessel.”\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM and ICD-10-PCS both require specific vessels for cardiac conditions and procedures. For example, a patient suffers an acute MI. Where was the infarction? ICD-10-CM includes specific sites, such as:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Left main coronary artery</li>\r\n	<li>Left anterior descending coronary artery</li>\r\n	<li>Diagonal coronary artery</li>\r\n	<li>Other coronary artery of anterior wall</li>\r\n	<li>Right coronary artery</li>\r\n	<li>Other coronary artery of inferior wall</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSome of those are easy (if the physician documents it). Some could be a little trickier. Do you know which smaller arteries are on the inferior wall and which are on the anterior wall?\r\n\r\nFor Dilation procedures (balloon angioplasty and stents) in ICD-10-PCS, you only need to know the number of coronary sites treated. For Bypass procedures, you need to know the number of sites bypassed from and where the bypass is going:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>3, coronary artery</li>\r\n	<li>8, internal mammary, right</li>\r\n	<li>9, internal mammary, left</li>\r\n	<li>C, thoracic artery</li>\r\n	<li>F, abdominal artery</li>\r\n	<li>W, aorta</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nDon’t code cardiac cases? You still need to know arteries. For a procedure involving an artery, for example, you will need to know which artery is involved, where it is located in the body, what approach the physician used, what type of repair he or she performed, and whether the physician used a device.\r\n\r\nConsider a patient with septic thrombosis of the choroid vein. If you know that the choroid vein is an intracranial vein, you’re all set. You can report ICD-10-CM code G08 (intracranial and intraspinal phlebitis and thrombophlebitis). You’ll notice all of the intracranial veins and sinuses are lumped into this one code. If you don’t know where the vein belongs and your physician simply documents septic thrombosis of the choroid vein, you’ll need to research the vein. This decreases productivity, which slows down cash flow and so on and so forth.\r\n\r\nIf you code for the ED or orthopedics, you definitely need to know your bones (not just where they are, but what kind of sections they have) and muscles.\r\n\r\nFor example, where would you find the navicular bone? It’s kind of a trick question because humans have a navicular bone in the foot as well as the wrist. The one in the wrist is also called the scaphoid bone. ICD-10-CM lists it as the navicular (scaphoid).\r\n\r\nThe navicular bone in the wrist can be fractured in the distal pole, middle third, or proximal third. Each has a separate subcategory in ICD-10-CM that includes options for laterality and displaced vs. nondisplaced.\r\n\r\nThe navicular of the foot doesn’t have those location differences. Your choices are displaced or nondisplaced, left or right.\r\n\r\nIf you only code one type of record all the time—for example, if you work for a pulmonologist—you probably only really need to brush up on the anatomy for that body system or area. If you work at a hospital or are part of a pool of coders, you might see a wide range of cases. Then you’re going to need to understand a wider range of anatomy.\r\n\r\nYou don’t need to take a full-blown anatomy course. Figure out what anatomy you already know well. Odds are you know some of it very well. Identify areas where you aren’t as strong and do some focused training. It can be as simple as looking at <i>Gray’s Anatomy</i> (again, the book, not the TV show).\r\n\r\nFind ways to make it fun. An anatomy version of <i>Jeopardy!</i> could be interesting. You can find a lot of free resources online, just make sure you choose ones from a reputable source.',

His friend warned that he might have a concussion so he came into the clinic to see Dr. Jones.\r\n\r\nDr. Jones examines Simon and does not find evidence of a concussion, just a forehead laceration and lacerations to both palms. Dr. Jones documents that no foreign bodies remain in the head wound or the right palm abrasions, but some gravel is stuck in the left palm.\r\n\r\nOur codes for Simon’s visit are:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S01.81XA, laceration without foreign body of other part of head, initial encounter (we don’t have a specific code for the forehead, so the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index directs us to S01.81-)</li>\r\n	<li>S61.422A, laceration with foreign body of left hand, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S61.411A, laceration without foreign body of right hand, initial encounter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe can also add some external cause codes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>W01.198A, fall on same level from slipping, tripping and stumbling with subsequent striking against other object, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>Y92.830, public park as the place of occurrence of the external cause</li>\r\n	<li>Y93.02, activity, running (sadly we don’t have a code to specify fleeing from fireworks)</li>\r\n	<li>Y99.8, other external cause status (leisure activity)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nDamian, by the way, is fine.\r\n\r\nOur second patient, Doug, comes in with an eye problem. Doug was running around with a lit sparkler and one of the sparks flew into his eye.\r\n\r\nSo what kind of injury does Doug have? If the little metal shaving from the sparkler is still in his eye, he may have a foreign body in the cornea (T15.0-) or a foreign body in the conjunctival sac (T15.1-). Alternately, he could have a corneal abrasion without a foreign body (S05.0-).\r\n\r\nThe code we choose will ultimately depend on the physician’s documentation, but we should note that S05.0- has an Excludes1 note for codes T15.0- and T15.1-, meaning those codes cannot be reported together.\r\n\r\nThat makes sense if you think about it. S05.0- specifies no foreign body, while both T codes indicate the presence of a foreign body.\r\n\r\nWe hope you have a safe and happy holiday and don’t end it at the Fix ‘Em Up Clinic!',

The crustacean, unhappy at being disturbed, clamped down on Holly’s right big toe, partially severing it and sending Holly to the Stitch ‘Em Up Hospital.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Crab-mad.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-3990\" alt=\"Crab mad\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Crab-mad-300x233.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"233\" /></a>Let’s start with the diagnosis.\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM includes codes for complete and partial traumatic amputations. In Holly’s case, the crab didn’t get the whole toe, so it is a partial amputation. ICD-10-CM further divides toe amputations into the great toe, lesser toes, and more than one toe. And of course we have laterality.\r\n\r\nSince this is Holly’s first visit for a traumatic partial amputation of the right great toe, we would report S98.121A.\r\n\r\nHolly needs surgery to reattach her toe, so Dr. Shelley is preparing to put Holly back together, and we can build our ICD-10-PCS code at the same time.\r\n\r\nFirst, we know we are in the Medical and Surgical section, which gives us a first character 0 (the number zero, not a capital O).\r\n\r\nOur second character is the body system. In this case, we’re going with lower extremities, Y.\r\n\r\nThe third character is the root operation. Basically what is the surgeon trying to do? Dr. Shelley is putting Holly’s toe back where it belongs, which makes our root operation Reattachment (N).\r\n\r\nNote that Reattachment is the root operation of choice whether the surgeon is putting all or a portion of a separated body part to its normal location or another suitable location.\r\n\r\nWe now have the first three characters of our code, 0YM, so we can go to the ICD-10-PCS table.\r\n\r\nThe table contains plenty of fourth character options for the body part. We know Dr. Shelley is reattaching Holly’s right great toe, so our fourth character is P (first toe, right). If Dr. Shelley reattached multiple toes, we would code each one separately because each has its own body part.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the code is a breeze because we only have one choice for each remaining character:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>0, open</li>\r\n	<li>Z, no device</li>\r\n	<li>Z, no qualifier</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThat gives us a final code of 0YMP0ZZ.\r\n\r\nHolly did get the last laugh on her crustacean attacker.

Are you coding records concurrently in ICD-9 and ICD-10, or are you coding in ICD-9 and then going back and coding in ICD-10? Figure out which approach will work best at your facility.\r\n\r\nAlso, are you coding natively in ICD-9 and ICD-10 or are you using some type of crosswalk? Again, that’s up to each facility to decide.\r\n\r\nOne caution about crosswalks, though. You can’t code from a crosswalk alone. That’s not their purpose. A crosswalk can get you to the correct area of the codebook, but it won’t give you the precise code in most cases. Most ICD-9 codes map to multiple ICD-10 codes because the ICD-10 codes are more specific. If every code had a one-to-one match, we wouldn’t need to move to ICD-10.\r\n\r\nA third point to consider: Is one person coding the same record in ICD-9 and ICD-10 or is one coding it in ICD-9 and someone else coding it in ICD-10?\r\n\r\nCindy Hutchinson, CCS, CCS‐P, corporate director of coding services for Intermountain Healthcare in Utah, shared that her coders are coding the same record in both systems. Initially, Intermountain wasn’t following that approach. Different coders were coding the record in ICD-9 and ICD-10. Once the coders started coding the records in both systems, Hutchinson said the decline in coder productivity was reduced.\r\n\r\nOne encouraging result for other providers is where Hutchinson’s coders are at nine months into dual coding. Most of the coders are now back to their baseline productivity, with the exceptions of complex surgical cases and Intermountain’s children’s hospital.\r\n\r\nLinda M. DiGregorio, RHIA, CCS, associate director clinical documentation, coding, and reimbursement for Winthrop University Hospital in New York, said her coders began dual coding with obstetrics cases in January. In February, they added concurrent dual coding of all hip and knee replacement surgeries, in addition to open reduction internal fixation cases. This month, they also began concurrently dual coding cardiac cases.\r\n\r\nDiGregorio said coding productivity has dropped 60%.\r\n\r\nHutchinson said she does not allow coders at Intermountain to  use any crosswalk tools, but DiGregorio said some of the Winthrop coders are starting to use them.',

And then snap. Not a good sound to hear. Even worse was when she realized the bone was sticking out of her arm.\r\n\r\nDr. Setter examines Julie and orders x-rays to determine the specific types and locations of the fractures. Because Julie’s fractures are open, he immediately schedules her for surgery at the Stitch ‘Em Up Hospital.<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/woman-falling-down-stairs.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-4000\" alt=\"woman falling down stairs\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/woman-falling-down-stairs-282x300.jpg\" width=\"282\" height=\"300\" /></a>\r\n\r\nWhen Dr. Setter gets the x-rays back, he determines that Julie suffered diaphyseal fractures involving the right radius and ulna. Hmm, I don’t think that’s enough information to get us to the correct ICD-10-CM codes.\r\n\r\nCodes for fractures of the forearm live in category S52. And you’ll notice a lot of codes under S52. They are broken down into:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Ulna and radius</li>\r\n	<li>Specific part of the bone</li>\r\n	<li>Displaced and nondisplaced</li>\r\n	<li>Left and right</li>\r\n	<li>Type of fracture</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nHowever, none of them are for a diaphyseal fracture. Now what? Well, if we check our handy medical dictionary (in book form or online) we can find out that a diaphyseal fracture involves the shaft of a long bone.\r\n\r\nWe do have codes for fractures of the shaft of the ulna and the radius—many, many codes. So it looks like we’re going to have to query Dr. Setter, unless of course our radiologist documented the details we need.\r\n\r\nWhen we check the radiologist’s report, we find documentation of a displaced transverse fracture of the shaft of the right ulna and a displaced comminuted fracture of the shaft of the right radius. Because Dr. Setter documented the fractures, we can pull additional details from the radiologist’s report.\r\n\r\nDr. Setter also noted this is Julie’s first visit, so we would report codes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S52.221B for the ulna fracture</li>\r\n	<li>S52.351B for the radius fracture</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nOne thing we don’t have is the extent of the soft tissue damage on the Gustilo-Anderson classification scale. We can query for it or just default to B (initial encounter for open fracture NOS) for our seventh character.\r\n\r\nGiven the seriousness of Julie’s fractures, Dr. Setter is admitting her to the Stitch ‘Em Up Hospital, where Dr. Breaker will perform surgery to stabilize the fractures.\r\n\r\nDr. Breaker documents an open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) of the right radius and right ulna. Be very careful with ORIF. Sometimes the physician calls it an ORIF, but actually reduces the bone (moves it back into place) before creating the incision to place the fixation device.\r\n\r\nIn Dr. Breaker’s notes, she documents making the incision prior to reducing the fractures. Note that we need to know this for both fractures. Because the radius and the ulna are separate body parts in ICD-10-PCS, we are going to report separate codes for them. It’s possible that one reduction was open and one was closed. Dr. Breaker documents the same procedure for both bones.\r\n\r\nWhat root operation does ORIF fall under? Well, what is the intent of the procedure? Dr. Breaker is putting the pieces of the bone back into their normal position. Sounds a lot like Reposition (moving to its normal location, or other suitable location, all or a portion of a body part).\r\n\r\nNow that we have our root operation (and our section, Medical and Surgical, and our body system, upper bones), we can head to table 0PS (that’s a zero at the beginning of the code, not a capital O—no capital O or I in ICD-10-PCS).\r\n\r\nWe know the body parts for our two codes: right radius (H) and right ulna (K). Now for the approach. Dr. Breaker documented an open approach, so our fifth character is 0.\r\n\r\nOur sixth character is the device and our choices are:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>4, internal fixation device</li>\r\n	<li>5, external fixation device</li>\r\n	<li>6, internal fixation device, intramedullary</li>\r\n	<li>B, external fixation device, monoplanar</li>\r\n	<li>C, external fixation device, ring</li>\r\n	<li>D, external fixation device, hybrid</li>\r\n	<li>Z, no device</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe can eliminate all but two of those choices very quickly because we know Dr. Breaker used an internal fixation device. We just need to know whether it is intramedullary. Remember to look at the device for each bone separately. Each bone gets its own code, so the devices may be different.\r\n\r\nIn this case, Dr. Breaker documents internal fixation device, but does not mention intramedullary. That makes our sixth character 4 for both codes. The seventh character is easy. We only have one choice—Z (no qualifier).\r\n\r\nFor Julie’s surgery we would report:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>0PSH04Z, reposition right radius with internal fixation device, open approach</li>\r\n	<li>0PSK04Z, reposition right ulna with internal fixation device, open approach</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWhen Julie comes back in for routine follow-up care, we will use the same main ICD-10-CM codes we used for the initial fractures, just with a different seventh character. That will help us track how well a specific treatment works for a specific injury and also let us keep track of how well Julie heals.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;',

However, some of Dr. Doolittle\'s documentation went astray (such as the clinical indications, diagnosis, and history), and this is all the information we have:\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><i>Confirmed identity of patient Jill, who was satisfactorily sedated. I used the MFL 1,000 for extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, delivering 1,000 shocks to the stone in the lower pole of the right kidney, and 800 shocks to the stone in the upper pole of the same, with change in shape and density of the stone indicating fragmentation. The patient tolerated the procedure well.</i></p>\r\nWhich ICD-10-PCS code would we report?\r\n\r\nLet’s start by determining what we know. Well, we’re in the Medical and Surgical section, which means our first character is 0.\r\n\r\nThe procedure involves the kidneys, which makes our body system the urinary system (second character T).\r\n\r\nFor the root operation, we need to figure out what Dr. Doolittle did. He documented “extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy” as the procedure. When we look up lithotripsy in the ICD-10-CM, we find two possible root operations:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>With removal of fragments, see Extirpation (taking or cutting out solid matter from a body part)</li>\r\n	<li>See Fragmentation (breaking solid matter in a body part into pieces)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nDr. Doolittle didn’t mention removing fragments, so it’s probably not Extirpation.\r\n\r\nIf you look up extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, ICD-10-PCS directs you to Fragmentation. So Fragmentation it is.\r\n\r\nThat gives us 0TF as our table. When we get to the table, we notice that the right kidney and the left kidney have their own body part values. We don’t have a bilateral kidney choice, so we’ll be reporting two codes, one for each kidney.\r\n\r\nOn to the approach. We have six choices in this table and no indication of an approach in the documentation, right? Actually wrong.\r\n\r\nAn extracorporeal medical procedure is one that is performed outside the body. That makes the approach external.\r\n\r\nThe table includes only one choice for a device and one for a qualifier, so the little grey cells get a break on the last two characters of our codes. Based on Dr. Doolittle’s documentation and our own sleuthing abilities, we would report:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>0TF3XZZ, fragmentation in right kidney pelvis, external approach</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nNow let’s go see if we can find the rest of Jill’s record.',

Dr. Smith documents the gangrene is due to diabetes. In ICD-9-CM, we would report two codes: 250.7x (diabetes with peripheral circulatory disorders) and 785.4 (gangrene). In ICD-9-CM, the gangrene is a CC.\r\n\r\nIn ICD-10-CM, we only need one code: E11.52 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic peripheral angiopathy with gangrene). What happens to the CC? We no longer have a secondary diagnosis to provide the CC. Do we lose out?\r\n\r\nNever fear, the Cooperating Parties came up with a way to solve the case of the disappearing CCs and MCCs. In ICD-10-CM, certain codes, such as E11.52, act as their own CC or MCC. As long as the physician documents enough information for you to report the combination code, this new twist shouldn’t affect coding at all. It might actually make it easier.',

He packed all the essentials—tent, stove, cell phone, skillet, sleeping bag, water, and of course, raw meat. Nothing like a good meal when you are out of doors.\r\n\r\nSadly for Larry, he forgot to pack matches, fuel for his stove, and enough ice for his cooler.\r\n\r\nHe also forgot to practice setting up his tent before setting off for the great outdoors. And Larry apparently is not very coordinated.\r\n\r\nWhen he tried to set up his tent, he realized he also forgot to pack a hammer to drive the tent stakes into the ground. Not to be deterred, Larry found a really big rock to use instead. Apparently, Larry’s aim was off and instead of driving in the stake, he smashed his thumb.\r\n\r\nIf Larry sought treatment for his thumb injury, we would need to know:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Which thumb (Larry is right-handed, so he smashed his left thumb)</li>\r\n	<li>Whether the nail is injured (it’s not, Larry didn’t hit it that hard)</li>\r\n	<li>Episode of care (first visit)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nFor Larry’s thumb contusion, we would report S60.012A (contusion of left thumb without damage to nail, initial encounter).\r\n\r\nSince he knows some basic first aid, Larry opens his cooler (with the raw meat inside), takes out some ice, wraps it in a spare shirt, and applies the ice-filled shirt to his throbbing thumb.\r\n\r\nWhile he’s waiting for the pain to subside (he also forgot to pack some aspirin), Larry wanders over to sit on a boulder and enjoy the view. Alas, he forgot to close the lid on the cooler and the smell of Larry’s uncooked meat draws the interest of a mountain lion.\r\n\r\nThe mountain lion arrives to raid the cooler and Larry decided to defend his dinner. He snatches up a tree branch and attempts to ward off the mountain lion, who is unimpressed by Larry’s makeshift club. The mountain lion knocks the branch out of Larry’s hand with a nice loud growl, sending Larry fleeing for the safety of the nearest tree.\r\n\r\nOn the way to the tree, Larry trips over a log and does a face plant into the dirt on the other side. In the course of this trip, Larry cuts his forehead and twists his ankle.\r\n\r\nIf Larry seeks medical attention for these injuries, we need to know a lot more information.\r\n\r\nFor example, does any of the forest floor remain in Larry’s laceration? We have two code bases to choose from in ICD-10-CM:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S01.81-, laceration without foreign body of other part of head</li>\r\n	<li>S01.82-, laceration with foreign body of other part of head</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBoth codes will require a seventh character, and to make sure it’s in the seventh position we need to add an X placeholder. You’ll also note that the forehead does not have its own ICD-10-CM code. It’s simple “other part of the head.” Not to be confused with unspecified part of the head.\r\n\r\nOn to Larry’s sprained ankle. Again we need laterality, and this time we also need to know which specific ligament. If you aren’t familiar with the ankle ligaments, ICD-10-CM includes choices for:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Calcaneofibular ligament (S93.41-)</li>\r\n	<li>Deltoid ligament (S93.42-)</li>\r\n	<li>Tibiofibular ligament (S93.43-)</li>\r\n	<li>Other ligament, specifically the internal collateral and talofibular ligaments (S93.49-)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe also have a code for unspecified ligament (S93.40-), but we’re trying to avoid using unspecified codes.\r\n\r\nEach of these codes requires two additional characters. The sixth character provides the laterality—right, left, or unspecified—and the seventh is the encounter.\r\n\r\nIf you find yourself about to report a code starting S93.409-, STOP. That code is an unspecified ligament of an unspecified ankle. That’s not going to cut it. At the very least, the physician should be documenting laterality. If he or she isn’t, you need to have a polite conversation about the importance of complete, accurate documentation.\r\n\r\nIt is highly possible that the physician doesn’t know which ligament, especially if he or she doesn’t deal with ankles much. So you could legitimately report an unspecified ligament. If the physician never provides that information, you might want to ask a CDI specialist to chat with the physician to find out why.\r\n\r\nNow back to poor Larry. He has picked himself off the ground while the mountain lion is picking the steak out of the cooler. Deciding that discretion is the better part of valor, Larry continues for the safety of the tree. Unfortunately he forgot about his damaged thumb in his quest to climb the tree and all he succeeds in doing is annoying the tree’s resident squirrels.\r\n\r\nThe squirrels, who weren’t too sure about this visitor in the first place, are now very unhappy and vent their displeasure by pelting Larry with acorns. For furry little rodents, their aim is pretty good and they succeed in hitting Larry in the eye, and also in knocking out one of his teeth.\r\n\r\nWhat type of eye injury did Larry sustain? Corneal abrasion (S05.0-)? Laceration of the eyeball (S05.3-)? Maybe it’s just a lacerated eyelid (S01.11-).\r\n\r\nWe’ll need laterality and the encounter to round out any of these codes.\r\n\r\nFor the tooth injury, we need to know whether the tooth is just cracked, in which case we would report K03.81.  If it’s actually fractured,  we need S02.5- with two placeholders and a seventh character.\r\n\r\nEither way, we don’t need to know which tooth. ICD-10-CM isn’t that specific, yet.\r\n\r\nHaving by now had his fill of the great outdoors, Larry throws his gear back in his car and heads for the nearest hotel.',

That’s the $64,000 question right now. We were sure (and so was CMS) that October 1, 2014, would be the date. And by and large the industry and HHS seemed okay with that date.\r\n\r\nThen Congress got involved. I’ve heard a lot of rumors about why Congress acted, but since no one has claimed credit (or taken the blame depending on your point of view) for pushing out the date, we don’t really know the reason for it. That also means we don’t know how to keep Congress from acting again.\r\n\r\nWill ICD-10 go live October 1, 2015? I hope so. I’d like to say I am 100% confident in the date, but once bitten, twice shy.\r\n\r\nThe problem comes down to credibility. Not just HHS’ credibility in saying October 1, 2015, is THE date and it’s not changing. We’ve heard that before and it changed.\r\n\r\nWe also have a credibility problem within the industry and within our organizations. Some people have been lobbying hard for ICD-10 and promoted it within their organizations. They created training plans, begged for budget money, harangued colleagues to complete training. They were going to make sure their organization was ready. And quite a few were on track for October 1, 2014. Then the latest delay happened.\r\n\r\nAre we going to be able to get people within our organizations to buy into 2015? Will they listen when we say, you need to be trained, you need to prepare, you need to sign the check for the training? Or will they look at us like we’re Chicken Little screaming that the sky is falling?\r\n\r\nICD-10 is coming eventually. We know that. I think even the physicians know it at this point. If we as an industry are ready—not just the big hospitals, but the small physician practices and everyone in between—there won’t be a reason to delay again. The hard part is making sure everyone is ready.',

A pair of hikers discovered Ötzi’s well-preserved mummy in the Ötztal Alps, near the border between Austria and Italy, in 1991. Since then, scientists have performed numerous tests on Ötzi and discovered a wealth of medical information.\r\n\r\nIn addition to his atherosclerosis, Ötzi also suffered from:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Lyme disease</li>\r\n	<li>Whipworm infestation</li>\r\n	<li>Tooth decay</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nHe probably suffered a head injury, according to proteins in his brain, before being shot in the shoulder by an arrow and bleeding to death. And because of his advanced (for the time) age of 45, he also suffered from worn joints, which probably caused pain.\r\n\r\nHow would we code Ötzi’s various maladies in ICD-10-CM?\r\n\r\nFor his atherosclerosis, we need to know whether it is a native vessel or a bypass. Since they didn’t do bypass surgery in Ötzi’s day, we’ll go with native vessel. That leaves us with these choices:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>I25.10, atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris</li>\r\n	<li>I25.110, atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery with unstable angina pectoris</li>\r\n	<li>I25.111, atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery with angina pectoris with documented spasm</li>\r\n	<li>I25.118, atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery with other forms of angina pectoris</li>\r\n	<li>I25.119, atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery with unspecified angina pectoris</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe also see a note to use an additional code, if applicable, to identify:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>coronary atherosclerosis due to calcified coronary lesion (I25.84)</li>\r\n	<li>coronary atherosclerosis due to lipid rich plaque (I25.83)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe team that uncovered Ötzi’s atherosclerosis noted a buildup of calcium in his arteries, so we’ll need to add I25.84 as a secondary code.\r\n\r\nOn to Ötzi’s Lyme disease. That’s a pretty easy one because we only have one choice: A69.20.\r\n\r\nIf Ötzi suffered complications due to his Lyme disease, we would use one of these codes instead:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>A69.21, meningitis due to Lyme disease</li>\r\n	<li>A69.22, other neurologic disorders in Lyme disease</li>\r\n	<li>A69.23, arthritis due to Lyme disease</li>\r\n	<li>A69.29, other conditions associated with Lyme disease</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe whipworm infestation is also easy to code. When you look up whipworm in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index, you find an entry for: whipworm (disease)(infection)(infestation) B79.\r\n\r\nBecause we know not to code only from the Alphabetic Index, we look up B79 in the Tabular List, where we find:\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">B79, Trichuriasis</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\">Includes:</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\">trichocephaliasis</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\">whipworm (disease)(infection)</p>\r\nNext up is tooth decay. When we look up decay in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index, we are directed to see Caries, dental. You may have already known that, but if not, the index directs you to the correct entry.\r\n\r\nThese codes require more information than just dental caries. For example, we need to know what kind of caries Ötzi had:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>K02.3, arrested dental caries</li>\r\n	<li>K02.5-, dental caries on pit and fissure surface</li>\r\n	<li>K02.6-, dental caries on smooth surface</li>\r\n	<li>K02.7, dental root caries</li>\r\n	<li>K02.9, dental caries, unspecified</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nFor caries on pit and fissure surfaces and those on smooth surfaces, we also need to know how far the caries penetrated:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Limited to enamel (fifth character 1)</li>\r\n	<li>Penetrating into dentin (fifth character 2)</li>\r\n	<li>Penetrating into pulp (fifth character 3)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nICD-10-CM does not require you to specify which teeth are involved.\r\n\r\nWhat about Ötzi’s fatal injuries—the blow to the head and the arrow wound?\r\n\r\nScientists documented that he suffered a craniocerebral trauma with major bleeding in the back of the brain, along with a skull fracture. Unfortunately, they didn’t say exactly what type of fracture.\r\n\r\nAs for the bleeding, Ötzi likely suffered a brain hemorrhage caused by an artery in the brain bursting and causing localized bleeding in the surrounding tissues. You’ll find the codes for traumatic cerebral hemorrhages divided by side of the brain:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S06.34-, traumatic hemorrhage of right cerebrum</li>\r\n	<li>S06.35-, traumatic hemorrhage of left cerebrum</li>\r\n	<li>S06.36-, traumatic hemorrhage of cerebrum, unspecified</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe codes also specify different times for loss of consciousness:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>without loss of consciousness</li>\r\n	<li>with loss of consciousness of 30 minutes or less</li>\r\n	<li>with loss of consciousness of 31 minutes to 59 minutes</li>\r\n	<li>with loss of consciousness of 1 hours to 5hours 59 minutes</li>\r\n	<li>with loss of consciousness of 6 hours to 24 hours</li>\r\n	<li>with loss of consciousness greater than 24 hours with return to pre-existing conscious level</li>\r\n	<li>with loss of consciousness greater than 24 hours without return to pre-existing conscious level with patient surviving</li>\r\n	<li>with loss of consciousness of any duration with death due to brain injury prior to regaining consciousness</li>\r\n	<li>with loss of consciousness of any duration with death due to other cause prior to regaining consciousness</li>\r\n	<li>with loss of consciousness of unspecified duration</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBecause we don’t know if Ötzi lost consciousness or specifically where the hemorrhage occurred, we can’t assign a code. We would need to query Ötzi’s physician.\r\n\r\nWe’ve now come to Ötzi’s final injury: the arrow in the shoulder. The arrowhead entered the left shoulder blade and came to rest near Ötzi’s lung. Although it did not damage any internal organs, the arrowhead severed an artery and Ötzi bled to death.\r\n\r\nIf we look up laceration, blood vessel in the Alphabetic Index, we are directed to see injury, blood vessel. We find lots of codes for blood vessel injuries. These codes, not surprisingly, identify the location of the blood vessel and, in some cases, the actual blood vessel itself. For example, we can code an injury to the common carotid artery.\r\n\r\nWhen we look at blood vessel, shoulder, we’re directed to see:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Specified, NEC – see injury, blood vessel, arm, specified site, NEC</li>\r\n	<li>Superficial vein – see injury, blood vessel, arm, superficial vein</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe know we are not dealing with a superficial vein because the physician documented that the arrowhead ended up near the lung. Our most likely code is S45.812A (laceration of other specified blood vessels at shoulder and upper arm level, left arm, initial encounter).\r\n\r\nAnd with that, we are at the end of the Iceman’s medical record.',

So why learn about how to code diabetes in ICD-10-CM now?\r\n\r\n“It’s never too early to start learning,” says <strong>Jillian Harrington, MHA, CPC, CPC-I, CPC-P, CCS, CCS-P, MHP.</strong> “By keeping the ball rolling, staff can continue to drive home those documentation improvement aspects to providers.”\r\n\r\nAnother advantage to starting now: “We as coders and CDI specialists can become experts in ICD-10-CM coding ourselves,” Jillian says. By becoming experts, we’ll know what is needed from a documentation standpoint and we’ll also know the coding guidelines before ICD-10-CM implementation.\r\n\r\nDiabetes coding won’t really be harder in ICD-10-CM, Jillian says, but it will be different. The codes will look different, the documentation requirements will change, and you can’t use 250.00 after October 1, 2015. (Don’t worry, though, ICD-10-CM does have an equivalent code.)\r\n\r\nJillian will gives coders, CDI specialists, and clinicians the inside scoop on how to code for diabetes in ICD-10-CM during the live 60-minute webinar<a href=\"http://hcmarketplace.com/icd-10-cm-diabetes-combine-coding-and-documentation\">, ICD-10-CM Diabetes: Combine Coding and Documentation for Greater Specificity</a><strong>.</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>S</strong>he will reveal how the new codes better represent a patient’s clinical picture and what information coders and CDI specialists need to see in the documentation to assign the most specific code. She’ll also review what the ICD-10-CM guidelines and <i>Coding Clinic</i> have to say about ICD-10-CM diabetes coding and offer some tips on getting physicians to improve their documentation.\r\n\r\nBe sure to join us at 1 p.m. Thursday, August 14, for the live webinar.

By now, you’ve probably seen the comparisons for fracture codes. ICD-9-CM may include only two code choices for a particular fracture (open or closed), while ICD-10-CM can offer more than 100 (sometimes more than 200) codes, which include laterality, specific site of the fracture, type of fracture, and encounter.\r\n\r\nSue likes to compare the code book to a phone book. If you look at the New York City phone book, you’ll find lots and lots of names. More than 8 million people call the Big Apple home. By contrast, Schenectady, New York, is home to slightly more than 66,000 people and requires a much smaller phone book.\r\n\r\nYou’ll still look up a name the same way. You just have more names to sort through in New York City.\r\n\r\nSame holds true for ICD-10-CM. (ICD-10-PCS is very different than ICD-9-CM Vol. 3).\r\n\r\nYou still look in the Alphabetic Index, you still go to the Tabular List to double check the code. The only difference is you have more code choices.\r\n\r\nIncrease specificity makes it easier to assign a code because it takes some of the guess work out of the process, Sue says.\r\n\r\nThat’s especially true in ICD-10-PCS. The ICD-9-CM Vol. 3 codes are so vague that one code could represent more than 100 procedures. That about ambiguity!\r\n\r\nWith all of the code choices in ICD-10-PCS, you’re more likely to find a code that represents what the physician actually did. And that should save time in the long. It will certainly give us more accurate data about the patient and allow us to tell a better story about the patient’s health.',

He took part in a s’more eating contest at camp last night. I’ve personally never understood the appeal of burned marshmallows, but to each his own.\r\n\r\nJeff was so determined to claim the s’mores title that he ate a few marshmallows that were a little too hot. As in, they were on fire. And while fire eating is fine for professionals, for a kid at camp, it’s not such a great idea.\r\n\r\nDr. Sunni Daze examines Jeff and documents burns to the mouth, pharynx, tongue, and lips.\r\n\r\nThe burns of the mouth, pharynx, and tongue are easy. One code covers all three and it does not specify degree of the burn. Since this is Jeff’s initial visit, we would report T28.5XXA.\r\n\r\nThe lip burns require a little more information. We need to know what degree of burns Jeff suffered on his lips. Fortunately for him, Dr. Daze notes the burns are first degree, so we would report T20.12XA (burn of first degree of lip[s]).\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM does not include separate codes for the upper and lower lip, so T20.12XA covers one lip or both.\r\n\r\nWe also find the following note under pretty much all of the burn codes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Use additional external cause code to identify the source, place and intent of the burn (X00-X19, X75-X77,X96-X98, Y92)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe definitely need an X00-X19 code, which in Jeff’s case is X10.1XXA (contact with hot food, initial encounter).\r\n\r\nThe X75-X77 codes are for intentional self-harm. Overeating burning marshmallows doesn’t quite qualify as planning to hurt yourself. Jeff just got caught up in the moment.\r\n\r\nThe X96-X98 are codes for assault. Again, not applicable in Jeff’s case.\r\n\r\nFor our place of occurrence, we’ll use Y92.833 (campsite as the place of occurrence of the external cause). Notice we do not need a seventh character for this code.\r\n\r\nOur second patient Grace tried to change the direction of the fan by grabbing the cage that houses the blades. Turns out that wasn’t the best plan. That \"squeeze\" caused the blades to hit the cage and Grace’s fingers.\r\n\r\nFortunately, the fan wasn’t going fast enough to sever any of Grace’s fingers, but she does have some wicked-looking lacerations.\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM finger laceration codes are very specific, as in you need to know which hand and which finger is involved. You also need to know whether the nail is damaged and whether any foreign body remains in the laceration.\r\n\r\nLet’s see what Dr. Daze documented:\r\n\r\n<i>14-year-old female with lacerations to the palm side of the right index, middle, ring fingers, no nail involvement. No foreign bodies remain in wounds. Flexor digitorum profundus tendon of index finger severed.</i>\r\n\r\nThe first injury we’ll code is the severed tendon, because it is the most severe injury. If you look under laceration (because the tendon was lacerated, right?), the entry for tendon directs you to see Injury, muscle, by site, laceration.\r\n\r\nOkay, so off to Injury, muscle, finger we go. And find all sorts of code options. The codes are divided into the forearm and hand level. We don’t have a code for finger level, so we’ll go with hand level.\r\n\r\nHowever, we can code to the specific finger. In Grace’s case, that’s the right index finger and code S66.120A (laceration of flexor muscle, fascia, and tendon of right index finger at wrist and hand level, initial encounter).\r\n\r\nThe other codes for Grace’s misadventure would be laceration codes for the middle and ring fingers:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S61.212A, laceration without foreign body of right middle finger without damage to nail, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S61.214A, laceration without foreign body of right ring finger without damage to nail, initial encounter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nDr. Daze is done for the day and so are we. Remember to make sure your food isn’t on fire before you eat it.',

What about shorthand in a medical record? Can you code from it?\r\n\r\nFirst, let’s look at what kind of shorthand you might see. Physicians may use a +, ↑, or ↓. Those symbols could mean positive (like a pregnancy test), increased level, or decreased level, respectively. The problem is, they aren’t very clear or specific.\r\n\r\nNa↑ could mean hypernatremia (elevated sodium) or it could just mean the sodium level has increased. Maybe the patient has a low sodium level and the physician is simply indicating that treatment to raise the level is working. It could mean the sodium level is a little high or significantly elevated. Maybe the physician just documented a slight elevation so he or she remembers to have it rechecked during the patient’s next encounter.\r\n\r\nBottom line: you just don’t know, so you can’t code from it.\r\n\r\nSo that means it’s time to query the physician, right? Well, it depends. First, make sure you review the entire record and see if the physician documented the information anywhere else more specifically. Maybe BP↑ was just a note on a summary sheet and in the history of present illness, the physician stated, “Patient’s blood pressure elevated.” No query needed. We have the information.\r\n\r\nMaybe the physician didn’t document it more completely elsewhere. Is the condition clinically significant?\r\n\r\nHypernatremia is a CC, so it could affect MS-DRG assignment and the patient’s care. You should probably query.\r\n\r\n↓BP could also be clinically significant because a low blood pressure could cause other health problems, such as dizziness, weakness, and fainting. Again, probably worth a query.\r\n\r\n↓low chloride is probably not worth querying, because it isn’t associated with any adverse health effects.\r\n\r\nIf you have providers who routinely seem to document using symbols, work with them to eliminate the symbols and document in clear words. (because we can’t code from symbols in any coding system). The better the physician documents, the better the story of the patient becomes.',

Sadly, not very. The fact is, most documentation doesn’t meet the current standards for ICD-9-CM coding, according to  Rhonda Buckholtz, CPC, CPMA, CPC-I, CENTC, CGSC, COBGC, CPEDC, vice president of ICD-10 education and training for AAPC in Salt Lake City.  Rhonda discussed documentation during an AAPC webinar August 15.\r\n\r\nThink about how many times you assign an unspecified code because the physician hasn’t documented the information you need. In coding we are not allowed to assume or guess or suppose. If the physician didn’t document it, we can’t code it.\r\n\r\nGood documentation isn’t about the code set. It’s about patient care. Physicians shouldn’t be documenting for payment. They should be telling the patient’s story.\r\n\r\nWhat should you tell physicians about documentation improvement?\r\n\r\nStart with the patient’s story. Would the physician know what went on with that patient based on his or her documentation alone? Physicians probably won’t remember specifics of a patient encounter three months down the road, so they need to document everything that happened in the encounter.\r\n\r\nCheck to make sure you can read the physician’s writing if you are still using paper charts. If you can’t read it, you can’t code it.\r\n\r\nEliminate the abbreviations. The physician might know what that shorthand note means, but coders and other clinicians might not. Ask the physician to clearly spell out the information.\r\n\r\nFocus on what they aren’t doing. If the physician is already documenting laterality, don’t spend time discussing it in training. Give them a “Great job on documenting laterality. That’s one of the elements we need in ICD-10” and move on.\r\n\r\nRemember that physicians can’t improve their documentation if they don’t know what we need. Show them the <em>ICD-10-CM Manual</em>. Then show them their documentation and point out what’s missing. Maybe the information isn’t missing, you just don’t know where to find it.\r\n\r\nWe don’t want physicians to write reams of additional information. They don’t have time to write an epic and we don’t have time to read one. In some cases, we only need a few extra words. One example Rhonda gave involves a superficial foreign body in a finger of the left hand. If the physician doesn’t say which finger, we need to use a default code. All we need is which finger and we can get to a more specific code. The physician only needs to add one word. Documentation improvement can be that simple.\r\n\r\nOf course, not all documentation improvement involves adding a single word. But knowing the ICD-10-CM codes and the guidelines won’t help you if the information you need is not in the record.',

What about the long term?\r\n\r\nICD-10 should actually speed up claims processing, according to Donna Smith, RHIA, project manager and senior consultant with 3M Health Information Systems in Salt Lake City.\r\n\r\nFor one thing, ICD-10-CM codes will better support medical necessity because they include more information, Donna points out. Right now, hospitals spend a lot of time copying records and shipping them off to payers because the ICD-9-CM codes are just so vague.\r\n\r\nICD-10 will also tell a better patient story. With the seventh character, you can actually follow a patient’s injury all the way through and see what kind of outcome the patient experienced.\r\n\r\nA better, more complete picture of the patient’s severity of illness should also help reduce denials, Donna says. If Dr. Adams says her patients are really sicker than Dr. Smith’s, ICD-10 will allow her to show it. And if you don’t have to appeal denials, you get paid faster and you spend less time fighting with the payers.\r\n\r\nLet’s not forget laterality. Joe comes in with a lacerated left index finger with injury to the nail. We have one code in ICD-9-CM (883.2). We’re reporting that same code for all 10 fingers.\r\n\r\nIn ICD-10-CM, we have separate codes for every finger, plus codes that specify whether the nail is involved and whether any foreign bodies remain in the wound. For our lacerated left index finger, we would choose between:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S61.311-, laceration without foreign body of left index finger with damage to nail</li>\r\n	<li>S61.321-, laceration with foreign body of left index finger with damage to nail</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBoth codes require a seventh character to denote the encounter.\r\n\r\nThe next day, Joe comes in with another finger laceration, this time of the left ring finger. In ICD-9-CM, we’re still reporting 883.2 and the insurance company may think we’re double billing or we did something wrong.\r\n\r\nHowever, in ICD-10-CM, we will report one of these codes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S61.215-, laceration without foreign body of left ring finger without damage to nail</li>\r\n	<li>S61.225-, laceration with foreign body of left ring finger without damage to nail</li>\r\n	<li>S61.315-, laceration without foreign body of left ring finger with damage to nail</li>\r\n	<li>S61.325-, laceration with foreign body of left ring finger with damage to nail</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAgain, we need a seventh character for encounter.\r\n\r\nThe payer can see that Joe injured a different finger, so we should be quickly reimbursed, which will save time (and aggravation).',

Do you know what the physician is actually doing? Do you know how it differs from a Billroth?\r\n\r\nA Billroth II procedure is a surgical procedure in which an anastomosis is created between the stomach and the proximal loop of the jejunum. In case you’re wondering, a Billroth procedure involves removing the pylorus and creating an anastomosis of the proximal stomach directly to the duodenum.\r\n\r\nIf you know that a Billroth II is also called a gastrojejunostomy, or if your surgeon documents gastrojejunostomy, you’re in luck. ICD-10-PCS includes two listings for gastrojejunostomy in the Alphabetic Index.\r\n\r\nOf course, two is not as good as one, but it gives us a place to start. Our two choices according to the Alphabetic Index are:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Bypass, stomach 0D16</li>\r\n	<li>Drainage, stomach 0D96</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe only difference between the first four characters of the code is character three, the root operation. We determine the root operation based on the intent of the procedure. So in a gastrojejunostomy, what is the physician doing? He or she is creating an anastomosis, basically a surgical connection between two structures.\r\n\r\nLook at the definitions of Bypass and Drainage. Bypass involves altering the route of passage of the contents of a tubular body part. Drainage involves taking or letting out fluids and/or gases from a body part. Based on the intent of the procedure, Bypass is our root operation.\r\n\r\nIn ICD-10-PCS, we assign codes based on the body part bypassed from to the body part bypassed to. Confused? Don’t be. The fourth character in the code is where the bypass began, in this case the stomach. The seventh character is where the bypass ends up, in this case, the jejunum.\r\n\r\nWe also need to know the approach:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Open</li>\r\n	<li>Percutaneous</li>\r\n	<li>Via a natural or artificial opening endoscopic</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe also need to know what type of device was used. Remember, in ICD-10-PCS you only code devices that are left in the patient after the procedure. For an anastomosis, we are connecting one body part to another. The physician probably isn’t placing a device, but read the operative report to be sure.\r\n\r\nFor an open Billroth II without a device, we would report: 0D160ZA (bypass stomach to jejunum, open approach).\r\n\r\nIf you aren’t sure what a physician is doing during a common procedure, ask the physician to explain it or make friends with your clinical documentation improvement specialists. They can probably help you out as well. You still have time to figure out what clinical information you don’t know and what procedures you commonly code. Make the most of that time.',

We’ve had delays mandated by both CMS and Congress, as well as ongoing attempts by the AMA to kill ICD-10 altogether.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/detective-with-footprints.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-4004\" alt=\"detective with footprints\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/detective-with-footprints-300x240.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"240\" /></a>Another discordant note is a lack of coder agreement. Not on the merits of ICD-10, but on which codes to assign.\r\n\r\nBoth 3M’s Donna Smith, RHIA, and AHIMA’s Angie Comfort, RHIA, CDIP, CCS, say determining the correct code isn’t a sure thing. Coders aren’t always ending up at the same code.\r\n\r\nWhy? Well, first of all, the system isn’t live so no one is really coding in it. We’re still doing some guess work.\r\n\r\nSecond, physician documentation is not where we need it to be even for ICD-9. As a result, some coders may be guessing or choosing an incorrect default code.\r\n\r\nThird, not everyone is finding the same information in the record. In many cases physicians already document laterality, Donna says; it’s just that coders might not know where to look for it.\r\n\r\nFourth, we still don’t have a ton of guidance for the grey areas. We have 30 years’ worth <i>of Coding Clinic </i>advice<i> </i>for ICD-9. We have a few issues for ICD-10.\r\n\r\nMany organizations are doing some type of dual or double coding. I’m not sure how many are actually checking to make sure coders are coming up with the correct answer. And that’s another problem. How do you decide who got the correct answer?\r\n\r\nYou need a plan, Donna says. Part of that plan should include identifying the top diagnoses and procedures at your organization. Pull actual cases that include those conditions or procedures and have all of your coders code the record.\r\n\r\nOnce you’ve done that, compare the results, Angie says. Did you all come up with the same answer? Probably not. Agreement rates are pretty low right now, according to Donna.\r\n\r\nSo you came up with one code and your coworker came up with a different one. Maybe a third coworker came up with something completely different. Now what?\r\n\r\nSit down and talk about it, both Angie and Donna say. No one knows everything about ICD-10 yet (no one knows everything about ICD-9 either and it’s been around way longer). Try to figure out why you came up with different codes. Did someone miss a piece of information in the documentation? Did someone make an assumption based on his or her knowledge of the physician’s habits? Is the physician’s documentation so vague that everyone was just guessing?\r\n\r\nIf you can’t come to an agreement among yourselves, ask <i>Coding Clinic</i>. Send the de-identified record to AHA and ask them how to code it. <i>Coding Clinic</i> loves real-life examples, Donna says. So send them in. The more actual documentation they can look at, the better they can answer questions for everyone.',

Clark, for one, will be very happy about that.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/car-with-luggage.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-4060\" alt=\"car with luggage\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/car-with-luggage-248x300.jpg\" width=\"248\" height=\"300\" /></a>Clark and his family just returned from a week-long road trip across the country with some harrowing medical adventures mixed in with the family fun.\r\n\r\nThings got off to a bad start when Clark’s wife Ellen ran over his foot with the family SUV in their driveway before the trip even started. Fortunately for Clark, Ellen wasn’t driving fast and he only suffered a badly bruised foot.\r\n\r\nWhat do we need to know to code Clark’s foot injury? If you said laterality and encounter, move to the head of the line.\r\n\r\nOur choices are:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S90.30-, contusion of unspecified foot</li>\r\n	<li>S90.31-, contusion of right foot</li>\r\n	<li>S90.32-, contusion of left foot</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe need a placeholder X and one of the following seventh characters to complete our code:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>A, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>D, subsequent encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S, sequela</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe term initial is a little misleading, because we will use A as the seventh character when the patient is receiving active treatment, such as:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Surgical treatment</li>\r\n	<li>ED encounter</li>\r\n	<li>Treatment by a new physician</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSo much for the foot injury.\r\n\r\nDuring their weeklong odyssey, Clark and the family stopped at Super Fun World Amusement Park. By the end of the day, Clark was far from amused.\r\n\r\nWhile on the roller coaster, Clark was struck in the head by a low-flying (but not slow-flying) bird. He ended up with a concussion, a bruise, and a really bad headache.\r\n\r\nIn ICD-10-CM, concussion codes live in subcategory S06.0X-. We have nine codes that specify whether the patient lost consciousness, and if so, for how long. We even have two codes to use if the patient dies.\r\n\r\nHowever, Clark did not even suffer a second of unconsciousness following the assault by bird, so we would report S06.0X0A (concussion without loss of consciousness, initial encounter).\r\n\r\nNote that we need a seventh character and, in this case, the placeholder is in the fifth spot. ICD-10-CM helpfully includes the placeholder in the Tabular List so we don’t forget it.\r\n\r\nIf Clark had suffered an open wound to the head or a skull fracture, we would code that separately, per ICD-10-CM guidelines.\r\n\r\nWe can also add some external cause codes (just because it’s fun and hey, the mainstream media likes to pick on our external cause codes):\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>W61.92XXA, struck by other birds, initial encounter (Clark didn’t get the name of the bird that hit him)</li>\r\n	<li>Y92.831, amusement park as the place of occurrence of the external cause</li>\r\n	<li>Y93.I1, activity, roller coaster riding</li>\r\n	<li>Y99.8, other external cause status (leisure activity)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nOn Day 4 of the trip, Clark and the family were driving through Death Valley (where summer temps routinely top 120°F) when the SUV decided to take a break. And so did the air conditioning. More problematic was the lack of cell reception.\r\n\r\nRather than wait for a passing Good Samaritan, Clark decided to hike back to civilization for assistance. Sadly, he forgot to stock up on water when he exited the vehicle and by the time he made it to the main road, he had a whopper of a sunburn and a case of heatstroke.\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM includes four codes for sunburn, based on degree:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>L55.0, sunburn of first degree</li>\r\n	<li>L55.1, sunburn of second degree</li>\r\n	<li>L55.2, sunburn of third degree</li>\r\n	<li>L55.9, sunburn, unspecified</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe don’t need to know the location of the burn, just the degree. Remember to code to the highest degree.\r\n\r\nFor heatstroke, we only see one choice—T67.0—but we need two X placeholders and a seventh character.\r\n\r\nClark wrapped up his week of woes with a nasty case of food poisoning after chowing down at a roadside taco stand. In order to code Clark’s food poisoning, we need to know the causative organism. Our choices include:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>A02.0, Salmonella enteritis</li>\r\n	<li>A02.9, Salmonella infection, unspecified</li>\r\n	<li>A05.0, foodborne staphylococcal intoxication</li>\r\n	<li>A05.1, botulism food poisoning</li>\r\n	<li>A05.2, foodborne Clostridium perfringens [Clostridium welchii] intoxication</li>\r\n	<li>A05.3, foodborne Vibrio parahaemolyticus intoxication</li>\r\n	<li>A05.4, foodborne Bacillus cereus intoxication</li>\r\n	<li>A05.5, foodborne Vibrio vulnificus intoxication</li>\r\n	<li>A05.8, other specified bacterial foodborne intoxications</li>\r\n	<li>A05.9, bacterial foodborne intoxication, unspecified</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nHappy trails and safe travels!

Sam invited his whole family over to his new house for a final summer blowout. Instead, Sam blew out his knee playing pick-up football.\r\n\r\nDr. Sunni Daze sees Sam and diagnoses Sam with a torn medial collateral ligament and a torn lateral collateral ligament.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Dr. Daze didn’t specify which knee in the diagnosis. She did, however, document that she examined his left knee, so we have laterality. We also know she is seeing Sam for the first time for these injuries, so we would report:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S83.412A, sprain of medial collateral ligament of left knee, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S83.422A, sprain of lateral collateral ligament of left knee, initial encounter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nShe refers Sam to an orthopedist for further treatment. When Sam sees the orthopedist for the first time, we will report the exact same codes, even the same seventh character. Seventh character A is used when the patient is receiving active treatment, including when the patient sees a new physician.\r\n\r\nOur second patient, Jake, fell victim to a vengeful squirrel during his family’s picnic in the park. The squirrel made a move to steal Jake’s potato chip for a snack. When Jake reached for it, the squirrel got a mouthful of Jake’s hand instead of the tasty treat. The squirrel took off, leaving Jake with a bleeding bite wound.\r\n\r\nDr. Daze documents the following:\r\n\r\n<i>Patient presents for initial treatment of open bite wound on hand caused by squirrel. Cleaned and irrigated wound. Placed five stiches in left hand. Applied sterile bandages. Prescribed antibiotics. Sent patient home with instructions for keeping the wound clean. </i>\r\n\r\nAgain, we know laterality and encounter, so we would report S61.452A (open bite of left hand, initial encounter).\r\n\r\nIf your payer requires external cause codes, we do have one for bitten by squirrel (W53.21). Don’t forget the placeholder and seventh character.\r\n\r\nOur final Labor Day casualty is Megan, who was taking in her first baseball game. Unfortunately, she forgot to pay attention at all times when the game is going on. Instead of catching that foul ball, she took it on the chin—literally. She suffered a broken jaw as a result.\r\n\r\nAs you’ve probably heard, ICD-10-CM fracture codes are full of all kinds of details. For a jaw fracture, we first need to know upper jaw (see fracture, maxilla) or lower jaw (see fracture, mandible). Chin is the lower jaw, so we will head to the mandible fractures, where we find these choices:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S02.600-, fracture of unspecified part of body of mandible</li>\r\n	<li>S02.609-, fracture of mandible, unspecified</li>\r\n	<li>S02.61-, fracture of condylar process of mandible</li>\r\n	<li>S02.62-, fracture of subcondylar process of mandible</li>\r\n	<li>S02.63-, fracture of coronoid process of mandible</li>\r\n	<li>S02.64-, fracture of ramus of mandible</li>\r\n	<li>S02.65-, fracture of angle of mandible</li>\r\n	<li>S02.66-, fracture of symphysis of mandible</li>\r\n	<li>S02.67-, fracture of alveolus of mandible</li>\r\n	<li>S02.69-, fracture of mandible of other specified site</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nNotice two things—we don’t need laterality, but we do need a seventh character. In order to find out which seventh characters apply, we need to go back to the top of category S02 (fracture of skull and facial bones). We have some additional seventh character choices for this category:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>A, initial encounter for closed fracture</li>\r\n	<li>B, initial encounter for open fracture</li>\r\n	<li>D, subsequent encounter for fracture with routine healing</li>\r\n	<li>G, subsequent encounter for fracture with delayed healing</li>\r\n	<li>K, subsequent encounter for fracture with nonunion</li>\r\n	<li>S, sequela</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIn addition to knowing the exact site of the fracture, we’ll need to know whether it’s open or closed.\r\n\r\nRemember, too, that you can take the specific site from the radiology report as long as the physician documents that the patient has a fracture of the jaw.\r\n\r\nKeep your eye on the ball at all times!',

If we had a patient who was faking a pregnancy, how would we code it?\r\n\r\nIt depends on our patient’s symptoms.\r\n\r\nA fake pregnancy in humans can be an outright lie, which could mean you are dealing with a patient who suffers from a mental disorder. In those cases, the patient may have a factitious disorder (deliberately and consciously acting as if you have an illness when you aren’t sick).\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM includes four code choices for factitious disorder:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>F68.10, factitious disorder, unspecified</li>\r\n	<li>F68.11, factitious disorder with predominantly psychological signs and symptoms</li>\r\n	<li>F68.12, factitious disorder with predominantly physical signs and symptoms</li>\r\n	<li>F68.13, factitious disorder with combined psychological and physical signs and symptoms</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSince the panda in question was only displaying pregnancy behaviors, we would code F68.11.\r\n\r\nSometimes, though, a woman may believe she is pregnant when she’s not. False pregnancy, clinically termed pseudocyesis, is the belief that you are expecting a baby when you are not really carrying a child. In ICD-10-CM, we would report F45.8 (other somatoform disorders).\r\n\r\nThe ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index includes the term pseudocyesis, but it’s not explicitly listed as one of the included terms under F45.8.\r\n\r\nNot every physician will diagnose a false pregnancy as pseudocyesis. Instead the physician may simply document the patient’s symptoms, such as lack of appetite, nausea and vomiting, enlarged breasts, milk production, and interruption of the menstrual period.\r\n\r\nThe physician may think the patient is pregnant, but orders a pregnancy test to be sure. If the physician orders a blood test, you won’t know the results when the patient leaves the office after the visit. If the physician documents “possible pregnancy” in the outpatient record, we can’t code pregnancy. We have to code the signs and symptoms.\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM includes two possible codes for lack or loss of appetite:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>R63.0, anorexia (loss of appetite)</li>\r\n	<li>F50.8, other eating disorders (psychogenic loss of appetite)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nFor the nausea and vomiting, we would report R11.2 (nausea and vomiting, unspecified).\r\n\r\nMake sure you are not coding the conditions separately, since ICD-10-CM also includes these codes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>R11.0, nausea</li>\r\n	<li>R11.10, vomiting</li>\r\n	<li>R11.11, vomiting without nausea</li>\r\n	<li>R11.12, projectile vomiting</li>\r\n	<li>R11.13, vomiting of fecal matter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIf our patient is an inpatient, we should know at the time of discharge whether she is pregnant. However, if the physician documents “possible pregnancy” for an inpatient, we would report the pregnancy code as if the pregnancy was confirmed.\r\n\r\nYou should already be used to that distinction because we have the same rule in ICD-9-CM. No coding of possible, probably, suspected, or rule out diagnoses on the outpatient. On the inpatient side, report them as if they were present.\r\n\r\nOn a happier note, another Chinese panda <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/world/asia/la-fg-panda-triplets-born-in-china-20140812-story.html\">recently gave birth to triplets</a>.

It gets lumped in with other specified viral infections in code 079.89. So in the U.S., we have no idea how many people suffer from Ebola (I think the last confirmed count was three).\r\n\r\nIn many other countries, they can monitor the rates of Ebola, along with a host of other infectious diseases. The code for Ebola in ICD-10-CM is A98.4, in case you’re wondering.\r\n\r\nYou may be thinking, who cares? Three cases of Ebola aren’t many. Why do we need to know?\r\n\r\nThe world is becoming a smaller place every day. Travel is faster and cheaper, and while security will pat you down looking for weapons, nobody checks to see if you are infected with a potentially fatal disease.\r\n\r\nStill don’t think it’s important to know what’s making people sick? Harken back to the glory days of 2002 when a new virus know as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) hit the world stage. SARS took only a few weeks to infect people in 37 countries.\r\n\r\nThe fatality rate for SARS was a little under 10%. Ebola is fatal in more than half of the cases.\r\n\r\nMore specific codes allow for better public health monitoring and better disease tracking. Without effecting tracking and monitoring, we can’t effectively identify and try to contain an outbreak.\r\n\r\nWe also can’t tell how well a particular treatment is working or even if it is working at all. And you certainly can’t determine how many people are dying from a disease like Ebola.\r\n\r\nMaybe you don’t care about swapping stats with other countries (I’ve heard that from a few people who are not in favor of moving to ICD-10). Personally, I’d like to know what’s out there that could kill me so I know what to avoid.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;',

In the Tabular List, F98.8 does not specify ADD, but does provide these conditions:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Excessive masturbation</li>\r\n	<li>Nail-biting</li>\r\n	<li>Nose-picking</li>\r\n	<li>Thumb-sucking</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nI know a lot of people who bite their nails (everyone I know has given up thumb-sucking and nose-picking though).\r\n\r\nI wonder if ICD-10-CM might have a better code for a short attention span. It doesn’t really seem to fit with the other listed conditions.\r\n\r\nBack to the Alphabetic Index. Under “attention, deficit disorder,” we find a subentry specifying “with hyperactivity.” For patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), we are instructed to “see Disorder, attention-deficit hyperactivity.”\r\n\r\nWhen we get to that listing in the Alphabetic Index, we find out that ICD-10-CM includes codes for several types of ADHD:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>F90.0, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, predominantly inattentive type</li>\r\n	<li>F90.1, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, predominantly hyperactive type</li>\r\n	<li>F90.2, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, combined type</li>\r\n	<li>F90.8, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, other type</li>\r\n	<li>F90.9, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, unspecified type</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIn the Tabular List (remember we should never code from the Alphabetic Index alone), we also find two notes.\r\n\r\nThe Includes note tells us that attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity and attention deficit syndrome with hyperactivity fall under category F90.\r\n\r\nThe Excludes2 note tells us that the following conditions are not included in F90:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>anxiety disorders (F40.-, F41.-)</li>\r\n	<li>mood [affective] disorders (F30-F39)</li>\r\n	<li>pervasive developmental disorders (F84.-)</li>\r\n	<li>schizophrenia (F20.-)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBecause this is an Excludes2 note, we can code both ADHD and these disorders in the same patient as long as the physician documents both conditions.\r\n\r\nAfter doing a little more research on ADHD, I’m pretty sure that’s actually not my problem. Well, at least I…oh, look, a squirrel!',

		'body' : 'With flu season just around the corner (hey, where did summer go?), Melissa took her 4-year-old son Andrew to Dr. Spock, the pediatrician, for his flu shot Wednesday.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Vaccine-needle.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-4084\" alt=\"Vaccine needle\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Vaccine-needle-193x300.jpg\" width=\"193\" height=\"300\" /></a>With a minimum of fuss (and a small bribe by mom), Andrew took his shot and headed home with Melissa.\r\n\r\nHow would we code this visit in ICD-10-CM? From a diagnosis coding standpoint, it’s pretty easy. If you look up Vaccination in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index, you’re directed to code Z23 (encounter for immunization).\r\n\r\nWe do need to pay attention to two notes with this code. First, ICD-10-CM instructs us to code for any routine childhood examination. In Andrew’s case, he was just visiting for a flu shot, so no routine exam. If he had gone in for a yearly physical or another problem and just happened to get his flu shot at the same time, we would code the vaccination second.\r\n\r\nThe other thing to note is Z23 is a very general diagnosis code. We don’t have codes for the specific vaccination. Instead, we need to report the vaccine using a HCPCS code for the drug and a CPT® code (in the outpatient setting) for the actual administration. ICD-10-CM includes a note in the Tabular List stating, “Procedure codes are required to identify the types of immunizations given.”\r\n\r\nAndrew weathered his vaccine administration fine, but when it comes to the actual vaccine, things didn’t go as well. When Melissa was getting Andrew ready for preschool Friday, she noticed the injection site was red, inflamed, and hot to the touch. Andrew also reported it was a little itchy.\r\n\r\nBack to Dr. Spock they go. Dr. Spock allayed Melissa’s fears of cellulitis and diagnosed an adverse reaction to the vaccine.\r\n\r\nWhat would we code for this visit? Instead of heading to the Alphabetic Index (although we could do that if we wanted to), we’re going to the Table of Drugs and Chemicals. The table is located in the front of the <i>ICD-10-CM Manual</i>, just like it is in the <i>ICD-9-CM Manual</i> and the tables work pretty much the same way.\r\n\r\nIn the ICD-10-CM Table of Drugs, we find the following headings:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Poisoning, accidental (unintentional)</li>\r\n	<li>Poisoning, intentional self-harm</li>\r\n	<li>Poisoning, assault</li>\r\n	<li>Poisoning, undetermined</li>\r\n	<li>Adverse effect</li>\r\n	<li>Underdosing</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe headers in ICD-10-CM differ from those in ICD-9-CM. For example, in ICD-9-CM, any poisoning that was intentional is classified as a suicide attempt. In ICD-10-CM, that category becomes poisoning, intentional, self-harm, which is a little more generic. Some people may intentionally poison themselves with a specific drug, but they are not attempting suicide.\r\n\r\nYou’ll also notice that the codes now start with T.\r\n\r\nUnderdosing is a new concept in ICD-10-CM, but it doesn’t really relate to Andrew’s vaccine reaction.\r\n\r\nIn ICD-9-CM, we don’t have a specific heading for an adverse effect. We use the therapeutic use column, which is a little ambiguous.\r\n\r\nHowever, we know that Andrew suffered an adverse effect from the vaccine, so we would use a code from that column. But which code?\r\n\r\nWe can find it two ways. First, you can look up “influenza vaccine” and lo and behold, there’s the code. Or you can look up “vaccine,” then scroll through the list to find influenza. Either way you still end up with ICD-10-CM code T50.B95 (adverse effect of other viral vaccines).\r\n\r\nBecause we know not to code from the Alphabetic Index alone, we check the Tabular List to make sure we have all of the characters we need and that the code actually matches the diagnosis.\r\n\r\nWe have the correct code, but if you flip all the way back to the start of the T50 series of codes, you’ll see a notation that a seventh character is required for all of the T50 codes. Since this is Andrew’s first visit for his adverse reaction to the flu vaccine, we would use seventh character A. The correct code is T50.B95A.\r\n\r\nWithout the A, the code is invalid and you won’t get paid.\r\n\r\nHowever, we’re not done coding just yet. If you look at the very beginning of the Poisoning by, adverse effects of and underdosing of drugs, medicaments and biological substances (T36-T50) category, you’ll see several more notes, including:\r\n\r\nCode first, for adverse effects, the nature of the adverse effect, such as:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Adverse effect NOS (T88.7 )</li>\r\n	<li>Aspirin gastritis (K29.-)</li>\r\n	<li>Blood disorders (D56-D76 )</li>\r\n	<li>Contact dermatitis (L23-L25 )</li>\r\n	<li>Dermatitis due to substances taken internally (L27.-)</li>\r\n	<li>Nephropathy (N14.0-N14.2)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWhat adverse effects did Andrew suffer? We know he had a rash and pain. If we look up rash, we find a code for rash following immunization:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>T88.1, other complications following immunization, not elsewhere classified\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Generalized vaccinia</li>\r\n	<li>Rash following immunization</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAgain we need our seventh character for the encounter, but we also need two placeholder Xs. Our final code is T88.1XXA.\r\n\r\nThe itch is a symptom that rolls into the rash code, so we don’t need to code it separately.\r\n\r\nFortunately, Andrew will soon be on the mend (vaccine reactions typically clear up in a few days).',

Why? Because ICD-9-CM isn’t getting it done anymore. ICD-9-CM is vague, out of room, and quite frankly, out of date.\r\n\r\nThink about this: The National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics actually sent a letter to the Secretary of Health and Human Services recommending the U.S. move to ICD-10 <i>more than 10 years ago</i>.\r\n\r\nHow do we make sure we actually implement ICD-10 next year instead of talking about another delay?\r\n\r\nTalk about the specific benefits of ICD-10 as they relate to your audience. Don’t talk to brain surgeons about the incredible amount of data you’ll be able to collect on fractures. They don’t care. Instead point out that ICD-10-CM includes more detailed codes for cerebral infarctions.\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM includes subcategories for cerebral infarction due to:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Thrombosis of precerebral arteries</li>\r\n	<li>Embolism of precerebral arteries</li>\r\n	<li>Unspecified occlusion or stenosis of precerebral arteries</li>\r\n	<li>Thrombosis of cerebral arteries</li>\r\n	<li>Embolism of cerebral arteries</li>\r\n	<li>Unspecified occlusion or stenosis of cerebral arteries</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThink how much better, Doctor, you will be able to follow your patient’s progress and track how well different treatment methods work with all of these additional details (ICD-10-CM also includes more detailed codes for sequela from a cerebral infarction). Image the research possibilities. Consider the medical and treatment advances you can make.\r\n\r\nAnd isn’t it all about better patient care? So let’s tell a better story about our patients. While we’re at it, let’s tell a better story about ICD-10 so everyone (or the majority at least) is on board with the transition.\r\n\r\nICD-10 is not harder to use. ICD-10-CM is similar in many ways to ICD-9-CM. You look up codes the same way, you still follow guidelines (90%-95% of the time it\'s the same guidelines), you still code from the Tabular List, not the Alphabetic Index.\r\n\r\nClinicians have provided input into ICD-10. In fact, the vast majority of ICD-10 updates come from physician groups, according to <b>Sue Bowman, RHIA, CCS,</b> senior director of coding policy and compliance for AHIMA in Chicago. No one is freezing the physicians out.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of physician misconceptions, doctors don’t need to learn to code in ICD-10. They just need to document better (really they need to document better in ICD-9, but that’s another story). Instead of hitting them with codes, introduce them to new concepts in ICD-10, says <b>Rhonda Buckholtz, CPC, CPMA, CPC-I, CGSC, COBGC, CPEDC, CENTC</b>, vice-president of ICD-10 training and education for AAPC in Salt Lake City. Those concepts include:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Laterality (which they should already be documenting)</li>\r\n	<li>Episodes of care</li>\r\n	<li>Anatomical location</li>\r\n	<li>Cause/type</li>\r\n	<li>Complication/manifestation</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSNOMED CT and ICD-11 are NOT viable alternatives. I’ve heard people push for use of SNOMED CT instead of ICD-10. That’s not going to work because they are complimentary systems, not interchangeable ones. SNOMED CT is designed for the primary documentation of clinical care. The ICD system defines the universe of diseases, disorders, injuries, and other related health conditions. And we’d have to figure out how to pay based on SNOMED CT. Any idea how long that will take?\r\n\r\nAnd for those who want to use ICD-11—honestly, we can’t wait that long. ICD-11 is still two to three years away from beta testing. Who knows how long it will take to modify for use in the U.S. We’ve been modifying ICD-10 for 20 years. Many of the concepts in ICD-11 are based on those in ICD-10. If you skip ICD-10, you miss that intermediate step. Never a good idea.\r\n\r\nLook for ways to get accurate information out about ICD-10. You can find plenty of resources online (just make sure they are reputable sources). Let’s make this the last year we’re planning to implement ICD-10.',

However, you should download the guidelines and read through them (if you haven’t already). You’ll notice that most of the guidelines are the same as those we currently use in ICD-9-CM, but you still need to spot the differences.\r\n\r\nNew for 2015 are these specific examples of sequelae:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Scar formation resulting from a burn</li>\r\n	<li>Deviated septum due to a nasal fracture</li>\r\n	<li>Infertility due to tubal occlusion from old tuberculosis</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe Cooperating Parties also updated the guidelines for sepsis, specifically the guideline for postprocedural infection and postprocedural septic shock.\r\n\r\nWhen the patient develops a postprocedural infection and severe sepsis, first report the code for the precipitating complication, such as code T81.4 (infection following a procedure). You should also report R65.20 (severe sepsis without septic shock) and a code for the systemic infection.\r\n\r\nIf the postprocedural infection leads to septic shock, you still code the precipitating complication first, but now report code T81.12- (postprocedural septic shock) and a code for the systemic infection.\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM now includes additional information on the seventh character for pathologic fractures. The seventh character denotes the episode of care.\r\n\r\nUse seventh character A when the patient is undergoing active treatment, which now includes evaluation and continuing treatment by the same or a different physician.\r\n\r\nThe guidelines further state:\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><i>While the patient may be seen by a new or different provider over the course of treatment for a pathological fracture, assignment of the 7<sup>th</sup> character is based on whether the patient is undergoing active treatment and not whether the provider is seeing the patient for the first time. </i></p>\r\nYou’ll find the same information under the guidelines for chapter 19, Injury, poisoning, and certain other consequences of external causes. You’ll also see some additional information on complications:\r\n\r\nFor complication codes, active treatment refers to treatment for the condition described by the code, even though it may be related to an earlier precipitating problem.\r\n\r\nThe guidelines further clarify that seventh character D is used when the patient has an x-ray to check the healing status of a fracture.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to external cause codes, the guidelines now specify that the seventh character for external cause should be the same as the one for the code assigned for the associated injury or condition for the encounter.\r\n\r\nYou probably know that you only assign a place of occurrence code once. Well, most of the time. ICD-10-CM now specifics that when the patient suffers a new injury during hospitalization (which should be rare), you can assign an additional place of occurrence code.',

General Equivalence Mapping (GEMs) <a href=\"http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/ICD10/index.html\">like those CMS posts</a> and other crosswalks are tools to help coders and, like any tool, they have their good points and bad points. Good point: they give coders a place to start. Bad point: they don’t get you to the final code.\r\n\r\nPut another way: GEMs will get you to the correct neighborhood, but they won’t get you to the front door.\r\n\r\nCMS even admits the limitations of the GEMs, stating: “There is no simple crosswalk from I-9 to I-10 in the GEM files.”\r\n\r\nIn some cases, you will find a one-to-one correlation from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM (forget about it when it comes to ICD-9-CM procedure codes and ICD-10-PCS).\r\n\r\nFor example, Salmonella meningitis translates cleanly from 003.21 in ICD-9-CM to A02.21 in ICD-10-CM. Those cases are the exception. We wouldn’t need to move to ICD-10-CM if all codes were one-to-one matches.\r\n\r\nIn many cases, one ICD-9-CM code translates to multiple ICD-10-CM codes. Consider ICD-9-CM code 733.93 (stress fracture of tibia or fibula).\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM contains five choices that could match 733.93:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>M84.361-, stress fracture, right tibia</li>\r\n	<li>M84.362-, stress fracture, left tibia</li>\r\n	<li>M84.363-, stress fracture, right fibula</li>\r\n	<li>M84.364-, stress fracture, left fibula</li>\r\n	<li>M84.369-, stress fracture, unspecified tibia and fibula</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nOdds are, the GEM will take you to M84.369, which really tells you nothing about the actual fracture. No laterality, no specific bone.\r\n\r\nIt’s also not a valid code as is. It requires one of these seventh character to denote the encounter:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>A, initial encounter for fracture</li>\r\n	<li>D, subsequent encounter for fracture with routine healing</li>\r\n	<li>G, subsequent encounter for fracture with delayed healing</li>\r\n	<li>K, subsequent encounter for fracture with nonunion</li>\r\n	<li>P, subsequent encounter for fracture with malunion</li>\r\n	<li>S, sequela</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThat information is not included in the ICD-9-CM code you’re crosswalking.\r\n\r\nGEMs have other drawbacks as well. By now, you’ve probably heard that diabetes codes in ICD-10-CM no longer specify controlled or uncontrolled. ICD-10-CM also includes five subcategories of diabetes codes compared to two in ICD-9-CM. No way those codes will match up.\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM also includes different ways of classifying conditions. Consider complications of pregnancy. ICD-9-CM classifies them as:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Unspecified episode of care</li>\r\n	<li>Delivered</li>\r\n	<li>Antepartum</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nICD-10-CM codes instead classify them by trimester:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>First trimester</li>\r\n	<li>Second trimester</li>\r\n	<li>Third trimester</li>\r\n	<li>Unspecified trimester</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAn antepartum episode of care could fall into any of those trimesters. The OB/GYN is probably documenting somewhere in the patient’s record which trimester she is in. By just using a crosswalk, you lose that detail and likely end up with an unspecified code.\r\n\r\nUnspecified codes aren’t the end of the world, but they do defeat part of the purpose for moving to ICD-10-CM. They could also result in denials. We don’t know for sure yet, but why take the chance?\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM includes a few different guidelines from ICD-9-CM (not many, but you still need to know them). GEMs won’t take those guideline changes into account. And you may or may not end up at the correct combination codes (ICD-10-CM includes a lot of those).\r\n\r\nThe best way to learn to code in ICD-10-CM is to actually code the record using the <i>ICD-10-CM Manual</i>. In fact, almost half of the providers responding to the WEDI survey plan to do just that. If your organization is using just GEMs, you may need to do a little work on your own or explain why GEMs alone aren’t the answer. It’s more work now, but it will pay off after the transition.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;',

He is currently in intensive care after suffering a diffuse axonal injury.\r\n\r\nLet’s start at the very beginning. A diffuse axonal injury is a severe traumatic brain injury or severe closed head injury. That tells us we will not be coding for an open head injury. Diffuse also tells us that the injury does not involve one specific area of the brain like a focal brain injury (ICD-10-CM includes specific codes for focal injuries). Instead a diffuse axonal injury affects a widespread area of the brain.\r\n\r\nHow will we look up a diffuse axonal injury in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index? The place to start is Injury. We have pages and pages of injury codes in ICD-10-CM.\r\n\r\nWould you look under “axonal” or “brain”? If you said brain, you’re correct. I tried looking up Injury, axonal and got nowhere. I also tried diffuse axonal with no luck.\r\n\r\nUnder injury, brain (traumatic), we have an entry for diffuse (axonal), which directs us to S06.2X-.\r\n\r\nA quick aside before we head to the Tabular List. As with ICD-9-CM, in ICD-10-CM when words appear in parentheses, they are nonessential modifiers. That means we don’t need them to code, but they help tell us we’re in the right place.\r\n\r\nOff to the Tabular List to identify our additional characters. We find the following choices, broken down by the length of any associated loss of consciousness (LOC):\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S06.2X0-, diffuse traumatic brain injury without loss of consciousness</li>\r\n	<li>S06.2X1-, diffuse traumatic brain injury with loss of consciousness of 30 minutes or less</li>\r\n	<li>S06.2X2-, diffuse traumatic brain injury with loss of consciousness of 31 minutes to 59 minutes</li>\r\n	<li>S06.2X3-, diffuse traumatic brain injury with loss of consciousness of 1 hour to 5 hours 59 minutes</li>\r\n	<li>S06.2X4-, diffuse traumatic brain injury with loss of consciousness of 6 hours to 24 hours</li>\r\n	<li>S06.2X5-, diffuse traumatic brain injury with loss of consciousness greater than 24 hours with return to pre-existing conscious levels</li>\r\n	<li>S06.2X6-, diffuse traumatic brain injury with loss of consciousness greater than 24 hours without return to pre-existing conscious level with patient surviving</li>\r\n	<li>S06.2X7-, diffuse traumatic brain injury with loss of consciousness of any duration with death due to brain injury prior to regaining consciousness</li>\r\n	<li>S06.2X8-, diffuse traumatic brain injury with loss of consciousness of any duration with death due to other cause prior to regaining consciousness</li>\r\n	<li>S06.2X9-, diffuse traumatic brain injury with loss of consciousness of unspecified duration</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nNote that these are not complete codes. We need a seventh character to indicate the encounter. You’ll need to go back to the beginning of category S06 (intracranial injury) to find that information.\r\n\r\nCategory S06 also includes these notes:\r\n\r\nCode also any associated:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Open wound of head (S01.-)</li>\r\n	<li>Skull fracture (S02.-)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe face two challenges whenselecting the correct code. First, does the documentation specify the length of the LOC? Based on information in the media right now, we’re looking at an LOC of greater than 24 hours. That eliminates the first five codes.\r\n\r\nAnd it brings us to the second challenge—how well did the patient return to pre-existing conscious level? We may not know the final amount of recovery at the time of discharge (assuming the patient survives—the prognosis for diffuse axonal injuries isn’t very good). Brain injuries are complex and can take a significant amount of time to heal.\r\n\r\nThe code we assign at discharge will be based on the patient’s status at that time.',

		'body' : 'Saturday marks the 165th anniversary of the death of Edgar Allan Poe, but sadly, we’re still not sure of the cause of Poe’s demise. We do, however, have plenty of theories.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Raven.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-4105\" alt=\"Raven\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Raven-300x300.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a>First is the popular “he drank himself to death” theory that many people have heard. Poe was found “in great distress” outside of a polling place in Baltimore and died four days later.\r\n\r\nIf Poe, who couldn’t really hold his liquor, did succumb to alcohol poisoning, how would we code it? First, we head to the Table of Drugs and Chemicals, then find alcohol and its 28 related entries. Apparently you can be poisoned by a lot of different types of alcohol.\r\n\r\nIn Poe’s case, it was probably ethanol (T51.0X-). In fact, 13 of the terms under alcohol in the Table of Drugs direct you to T51.0X-.\r\n\r\nNow we need the intent behind the poisoning. We have specific codes for:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Accidental (unintentional)</li>\r\n	<li>Intentional self-harm</li>\r\n	<li>Assault</li>\r\n	<li>Undetermined</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe also need a seventh character to denote the encounter. We have three choices:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>A, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>D, subsequent encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S, sequela</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nMost likely, the alcohol poisoning (if that’s what put an end to the poet) was accidental, so we would report T51.0X1A.\r\n\r\nHowever, we are faced with a more sinister possibility. Some have speculated that Poe was actually the victim of cooping, a method of voter fraud practiced by gangs in the 19th century. The gangs would kidnap people and take them around to various polling places so they could vote multiple times. After each successful casting of the ballot, the gang would reward their victim with alcohol.\r\n\r\nYou might be able to make a case for this being an assault, although that is probably a tough sell. You could also make a case for undetermined.\r\n\r\nYou’ll also find the following note under T51.01X-:\r\n\r\nExcludes2:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Acute alcohol intoxication or \'hangover\' effects (F10.129, F10.229, F10.929)</li>\r\n	<li>Drunkenness (F10.129, F10.229, F10.929)</li>\r\n	<li>Pathological alcohol intoxication (F10.129, F10.229, F10.929)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAn Excludes2 note tells us that the conditions listed are not part of T50.1X-, but a patient could be suffering from one of these conditions as well. So if Poe’s doctor documented pathological alcohol intoxication, we would code it in addition to the alcohol poisoning.\r\n\r\nNot everyone is convinced that Poe died from too much drink. Another popular theory is rabies. Many of Poe’s symptoms fit. He was admitted to a hospital due to “lethargy and confusion.”\r\n\r\nOnce admitted, his condition rapidly declined and he exhibited:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Delirium</li>\r\n	<li>Visual hallucinations</li>\r\n	<li>Wide variations in pulse rate and rapid</li>\r\n	<li>Shallow breathing</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nFour days after being admitted, Poe died. Four days is the median survival rate after the onset of serious rabies symptoms.\r\n\r\nRabies, however, is not a perfect fit. Poe did not display hydrophobia, which commonly afflicts those with rabies. He also didn’t have signs of an animal bite.\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM offers three codes for rabies:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>A82.0, sylvatic rabies</li>\r\n	<li>A82.1, urban rabies</li>\r\n	<li>A82.9, rabies, unspecified</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe would probably go with unspecified rabies because we don’t know where Poe was infected (if he even was). The author was missing for several days before he was found lying in the street incoherent.\r\n\r\nPerhaps flu felled the master of the macabre. Poe may have been suffering from influenza, which may have turned into pneumonia. Poe is reported to have been ill before he left Richmond, Virginia, to travel to Philadelphia. A high fever might account for his hallucinations and his confusion and the rain in Baltimore may explain his second-hand clothes.\r\n\r\nIf this was indeed Poe’s cause of death, we would code both the influenza and the pneumonia. And we can probably code it with a single combination code.\r\n\r\nPoe’s pneumonia was likely either bacterial or viral. Code categories J13 (pneumonia due to Streptococcus pneumonia), J14 (pneumonia due to Hemophilus influenza), J15 (bacterial pneumonia, not elsewhere classified), and J16 (pneumonia due to other infectious organisms, not elsewhere classified) all instruct codes to first code any associated influenza.\r\n\r\nHowever, when you look up “influenza” in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index, you will find a listing for “influenza with pneumonia.” The index entry leads to you a very non-specific code: J11.00 (influenza due to unidentified influenza virus with unspecified type of pneumonia).\r\n\r\nThat’s probably the code we need to report because we don’t have any additional information (and we can’t query the physician. At this point, he’s dead too).\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that the <i>ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting</i> tell us it’s okay to report unspecified codes. Guideline B.18 in fact uses pneumonia as an example:\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><i>When sufficient clinical information isn’t known or available about a particular health condition to assign a more specific code, it is acceptable to report the appropriate “unspecified” code (e.g., a diagnosis of pneumonia has been determined, but not the specific type).</i></p>\r\nThe guidelines also state that the physician shouldn’t perform tests just for more specificity.\r\n\r\nPoe’s official cause of death, the one on his death certificate, is phrenitis, or swelling of the brain.\r\n\r\nIf you look up “phrenitis” in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index, you’re directed to “see encephalitis.”\r\n\r\nNot surprisingly, we find a plethora of choices, including alcoholic encephalopathy (G31.2). We would need the physician to document alcoholic encephalopathy before we can code it.\r\n\r\nSadly Poe’s medical records have gone missing and shall be seen nevermore.',

He took some aspirin and went to sleep.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Swollen-eye_tired-eye.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-4110\" alt=\"Swollen eye_tired eye\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Swollen-eye_tired-eye-300x236.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"236\" /></a>When he woke up this morning, he had troubled seeing out of his left eye because his left eyelid was drooping so much. He says overall his vision is blurry and the area around his left eye is very painful.\r\n\r\nFortunately for Jeff, Dr. Achy is on the case. Dr. Achy documented that Jeff’s left pupil was 6 mm in diameter and reactive to light. She performed a neurological exam and ordered x-rays, both of which were normal.\r\n\r\nTo be on the safe side, Dr. Achy ordered an MRI and magnetic resonance angiography to rule out really bad things such as tumors and aneurysms. Again, the tests came back normal. Dr. Achy also ruled out glaucoma.\r\n\r\nDr. Achy prescribed two aspirin and Jeff’s symptoms almost completely resolved. It’s a miracle, but what on earth is wrong with Jeff?\r\n\r\nHe has an ophthalmoplegic migraine, a very rare headache that tends to occur in younger adults.\r\n\r\nThe pain centers around one eye and is usually less intense than in a standard migraine. It may be accompanied by vomiting, double vision, a droopy eyelid, and paralysis of eye muscles. Attacks can last from hours to months.\r\n\r\nIn ICD-9-CM, we would report code 346.20 (variants of migraine, not elsewhere classified, without mention of intractable migraine without mention of status migrainosus). That doesn’t really tell us much about Jeff’s specific condition. “Without mention” appears twice in the code description and it’s a not elsewhere classified code—we have information, but no specific code available.\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM resolves part of that problem. We will have a code for ophthalmoplegic migraine. In fact, we have two:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>G43.B0, ophthalmoplegic migraine, not intractable</li>\r\n	<li>G43.B1, ophthalmoplegic migraine, intractable</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe know the migraine is not intractable because it resolved with standard treatment. First, Dr. Achy didn’t document it as intractable. Second, “intractable” means the headache doesn’t resolve with the usual treatment. Jeff’s condition improved after he took some aspirin.\r\n\r\nThat gives us G43.B0.\r\n\r\nIf you see a lot of migraine patients in your facility or organization, check the physician documentation to make sure he or she is noting the type of migraine, e.g., with aura, without aura, with status migrainosus, persistent.\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM includes much more detailed choices for migraines so if your physicians aren’t documented to the level of specificity you need in ICD-10-CM, start working with them now.

CJD is divided into three major categories:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Sporadic CJD</li>\r\n	<li>Hereditary CJD</li>\r\n	<li>Acquired CJD</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nOn October 1, 2008, the Cooperating Parties revised and expanded the ICD-9-CM codes for CJD to include:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease: Report code 046.11</li>\r\n	<li>Other and unspecified Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease: Report code 046.19</li>\r\n	<li>Dementia in conditions classified elsewhere without behavioral disturbance: Report code 294.10</li>\r\n	<li>Dementia in conditions classified elsewhere with behavioral disturbance: Report code 294.11</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe revised code description for code 046 includes slow virus infections and prion diseases of the central nervous system. The fifth digit represents the form of the disease. Currently, only variant CJD has a fifth digit of a 1. Report code 046.19 for all other forms.\r\n\r\nWhen a patient develops dementia with or without behavioral disturbance, report an additional code to represent the dementia.\r\n\r\nWhen we get to ICD-10-CM, our coding will look like this:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, unspecified, or Jakob-Creutzfeldt disease, unspecified: A81.00</li>\r\n	<li>Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease: A81.01</li>\r\n	<li>Other Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease including familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, iatrogenic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and subacute spongiform encephalopathy (with dementia): A81.09</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nCategory A81 (atypical virus infections of central nervous system) still includes diseases of the central nervous system caused by prions.\r\n\r\nAnd we will still use an additional code to identify:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Dementia with behavioral disturbance (F02.81)</li>\r\n	<li>Dementia without behavioral disturbance (F02.80)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWhile you’re unlikely to see a large number CJD diagnoses, you probably code for patients with anemia, hypertension, heart failure, migraine, stroke, and syncope.

Most women have some facial hair (otherwise we wouldn’t need all of the beauty products promising to do away with the unsightly stuff). However, some women have it worse than most of us. They actually end up with a beard or mustache. This can be the result of the genetic disorder hypertrichosis.\r\n\r\nIn ICD-10-CM, codes for hypertrichosis appear in three different sections.\r\n\r\nThe first category, L68 (hypertrichosis), includes excess hair. However, the Excludes1 note tells us that we cannot code these conditions in a patient with hypertrichosis:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Congenital hypertrichosis (Q84.2)</li>\r\n	<li>Persistent lanugo (Q84.2)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nExcludes1 means mutually exclusive. You can’t have the two conditions together.\r\n\r\nCategory L68 includes the following subcategories:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>L68.0, hirsutism</li>\r\n	<li>L68.1, acquired hypertrichosis lanuginosa</li>\r\n	<li>L68.2, localized hypertrichosis</li>\r\n	<li>L68.3, polytrichia</li>\r\n	<li>L68.8, other hypertrichosis</li>\r\n	<li>L68.9, hypertrichosis, unspecified</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe’ve already mentioned the second place hypertrichosis codes appear: Q84.2 (other congenital malformations of hair).\r\n\r\nThe final set of hypertrichosis codes appears in subcategory H02.86 (hypertrichosis of eyelid). The codes are divided by the upper and lower eyelid, as well as laterality.\r\n\r\nAnother performer in the freak show is lobster boy. Real or fake? Actually, it’s a real condition. In the mid-1900s, Grady Franklin Stiles Jr., suffered from ectrodactyly, in which the fingers and toes are fused together.\r\n\r\nIf you look up ectrodactyly in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index, you won’t find the condition. You can find it in the ICD-9-CM Alphabetic Index with notes that tell you to see “absence, finger, congenital” and “absence, toe, congenital.”\r\n\r\nIf we look up “absence, finger” in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index we find two choices:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Acquired, Z89.02-</li>\r\n	<li>Congenital – See Agenesis, hand</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAgenesis is simply the failure of a body part to develop. Unfortunately, quite a few body parts can fail to develop, judging by the list of subterms under Agenesis in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index.\r\n\r\nFor agenesis of the hand, ICD-10-CM includes the nonessential modifiers “and fingers,” “complete,” and “partial.” Nonessential modifiers are just that—nonessential. So you use the same code even if the physician doesn’t document those modifying terms.\r\n\r\nWe have four code choices based on laterality:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Q71.30, congenital absence of unspecified hand and finger</li>\r\n	<li>Q71.31, congenital absence of right hand and finger</li>\r\n	<li>Q71.32, congenital absence of left hand and finger</li>\r\n	<li>Q71.33, congenital absence of hand and finger, bilateral</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nICD-10-CM does include an entry for “lobster-claw hand.” It leads you to code Q71.6- (lobster-claw hand). Here’s where physician documentation will really be important. If the physician documents “lobster-claw hand,” use the Q71.6- codes (with an additional digit to specify laterality). If the physician documents “agenesis” or “congenital absence of fingers,” just the Q71.3-.\r\n\r\nYou can spend a lot of time online searching for the distinctions between the two and you’ll even find “cleft hand,” which creates even more confusion. If you are unsure which condition the patient has based on the documentation, you can always query the physician.\r\n\r\nOur final freak show example was commonly referred to as Pinhead. These curiosities were usually people who suffered from microcephaly, a neurodevelopmental disorder that causes abnormal growth of the brain.\r\n\r\nThis condition is pretty easy to code. We have one choice in ICD-10-CM: Q02 (microcephaly), which also includes hydromicrocephaly and micrencephalon.',

		'body' : 'If I hear one more person poke fun at ICD-10-CM code V97.33XD (sucked into a jet engine, subsequent encounter), I am going to develop a very strong case of R45.850. (That’s homicidal ideation in case you don’t have your code book handy.)\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Angry-squirrel.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-4014\" alt=\"Angry squirrel\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Angry-squirrel-300x300.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a>First of all, most of the people making fun of this code don’t actually understand what the code is conveying. See the <i><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/30/technology/medical-billing-nears-a-new-era-of-ultra-specific-codes.html?a=1&amp;m=en-us&amp;_r=4&amp;\">New York Times</a></i>, <a href=\"http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2014/09/when_orca_bites_and_other_biza.html\">an Alabama physicians group</a>, <a href=\"http://www.healthcaredive.com/news/the-16-most-absurd-icd-10-codes/285737/\">Healthcare Dive</a>, <i><a href=\"http://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2014/03/25/bird-bite-there-code-for-that-for-hospitals-bureaucratic-code-blue/jrYQi92XEJGMFwZ72afVQP/story.html\">The Boston Globe</a></i>, and on and on and on.\r\n\r\nThe subsequent encounter part is not saying the person was sucked into a jet engine twice (what are the odds of that?). It’s telling us that the person is being seen for a subsequent encounter for injuries suffered when he or she was sucked into the jet engine. (And you can indeed survive being sucked into a jet engine as long as you are not on <i>Lost</i>.)\r\n\r\nThe seventh character is one of the main new concepts in ICD-10-CM. Maybe we need to do a better job of explaining what it means.\r\n\r\nIn most cases the seventh character indicates the episode of care. If the patient is receiving active treatment, you use seventh character A in most cases.\r\n\r\nIf the patient is being seen for routine follow up, the seventh character becomes D, again in most cases.\r\n\r\nWhen the patient develops a complication or a condition that arises as a direct result of a condition, that’s a sequela reported with seventh character S (always).\r\n\r\nFracture codes have some additional seventh characters for nonunions, malunions, delayed healing, and open fractures. Most injury codes only give you three choices: A, D, and S.\r\n\r\nDo the physicians at your organization know what the seventh character actually means? If not, here’s a perfect example you can use to explain it. V97.33XD doesn’t mean sucked into a jet engine twice. It means the patient is actually recovering from injuries sustained by his or her sole encounter with a jet engine.\r\n\r\nThe second reason this example drives me up a wall is because V97.33XD is an external cause code. It will never, ever, ever be the principal diagnosis. And you will almost never hold a claim for an external cause code. The only time you would is if a specific payer requires them. The <i>ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting</i> even state that there is no national requirement for reporting external cause codes. If you don’t report them now, you won’t report them in ICD-10-CM.\r\n\r\nSo why are we spending time talking about whether the patient was bitten by a chicken or a duck? It’s not going to change your payment. It’s probably not going to affect patient care. Although, if you are bitten by a wild animal, the physician may be more likely to worry that you’ll contract rabies.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately too many physicians (and Congress members) rely on the mainstream uninformed media for information about ICD-10. We need to focus the discussion on what actually matters, not on what makes the best punchline.\r\n\r\nFor example, ICD-9-CM has no code for Ebola. You may have heard of Ebola and, depending on where you are in the U.S., you may indeed be coding for Ebola. Outside of the running tally in the mainstream media, how can you tell how many people in the U.S. have Ebola? Right now, you can’t. In ICD-10-CM you will be able to track that number.\r\n\r\nIf a patient breaks his leg, which leg is involved? In ICD-9-CM, we have no idea. In ICD-10-CM, we will not only know which leg is broken, but we’ll also be able to follow that patient’s progress with the seventh character. We’ll be able to see how many times the patient came back for active treatment, how often he was in for routine follow up, and whether he had any late effects from the break. The main code stays the same. Only the seventh character changes.\r\n\r\nWe have less than a year until ICD-10 implementation. We need to take the initiative to get the right information out about the benefits of ICD-10. Don’t be shy. Share the real story.',

		'body' : 'Poor Mr. Frank N. Stein. He just coughed up a lung. Literally.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/shutterstock_114859414web.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-3664\" alt=\"shutterstock_114859414web\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/shutterstock_114859414web-300x281.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"281\" /></a>While it is possible to survive on one lung, it’s generally not recommended, so Frank is here at the Stitch ‘Em Up Hospital to get a new lung.\r\n\r\nFirst, what diagnosis code would we report for Frank? Well, he’s here for a transplant, so lung transplant would be his principal diagnosis, right? No.\r\n\r\nThe lung transplant is being used to treat a condition, such as COPD or cystic fibrosis. Remember that the principal diagnosis is the condition established after study to be chiefly responsible for occasioning the admission of the patient to the hospital for care. Frank wound up in the hospital because he has some disease or condition of the lung that resulted in him coughing one up.\r\n\r\nHe could have bronchitis, pneumonia, COPD, or perhaps necrotic lung tissue. You’ll need to read the physician’s documentation to find out the underlying condition that caused Frank’s admission. You’ll also need to make sure the diagnosis supports the medical necessity of the lung transplant.\r\n\r\nLet’s take Frank to the operating room and see what Dr. Shelley is going to do to fix this lung problem. Dr. Shelley documents that she implanted a new left lung using a donated lung from a cadaver.\r\n\r\nOur first character will be 0 (zero) for the Medical and Surgical section. Our second character denotes the body system—in Frank’s case the respiratory system. Our second character is B.\r\n\r\nThe third character is the root operation. What is the objective of the procedure? Dr. Shelley documents “implantation,” which is not an ICD-10-PCS root operation. However, we do have root operation Transplantation.\r\n\r\nThe official ICD-10-PCS definition is “putting in or on all or a portion of a living body part taken from another individual or animal to physically take the place and/or function of all or a portion of a similar body part.” That sounds like the procedure Dr. Shelley is performing, so we’ll going with Transplantation (third character Y) as our root operation.\r\n\r\nRemember, it’s up to us to determine the root operation. We need to apply the root operation definitions to find the one that matches the intent of the procedure. Just because a physician calls a procedure an Insertion doesn’t mean that’s the root operation we’re going to use.\r\n\r\nWe have enough information to head to an ICD-10-PCS table: 0BY.\r\n\r\nThe table gives us nine choices for a specific body part. Wait, we only have two lungs (two codes) and possibly a bilateral option. That’s three choices tops. How did we end up with nine?\r\n\r\nThink back to your anatomy and physiology. The lungs are made up of lobes—two on the left and three on the right. Each lobe of each lung has its own body part value in ICD-10-PCS. So our body part choices are:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>C, upper lung lobe, right</li>\r\n	<li>D, middle lung lobe, right</li>\r\n	<li>F, lower lung lobe, right</li>\r\n	<li>G, upper lung lobe, left</li>\r\n	<li>H, lung lingula</li>\r\n	<li>J, lower lung lobe, left</li>\r\n	<li>K, lung, right</li>\r\n	<li>L, lung, left</li>\r\n	<li>M, lungs, bilateral</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe know Dr. Shelley is transplanting the entire left lung, so our fourth character will be L.\r\n\r\nOur next two characters are pretty easy because we only have one choice for each. The approach is always open and no device is ever used. Quick aside, device has a very specific meaning in ICD-10-PCS. You only code a device when it remains in the patient after the procedure is completed. So stents are devices, but sutures and temporary wound drains are not.\r\n\r\nThat brings us to the seventh character: the qualifier. For transplants, the qualifier denotes the type of tissue used in the transplant. For lung transplants, the tissue can be:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>0, allogeneic (non-identical donor of the same species)</li>\r\n	<li>1, syngeneic (an identical member of the same species, i.e., an identical twin)</li>\r\n	<li>2, zooplastic (from a different species)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nDr. Shelley documented that the donor organ came from a cadaver and did not indicate that the donor was Frank’s identical twin brother, so our seventh character is 0.\r\n\r\nOur final code is 0BYL0Z0 (Transplantation of left lung, allogeneic, open approach).\r\n\r\nThat code contains quite a bit of information: the organ, the laterality, the procedure, how it was done, where the donor organ came from.\r\n\r\nIn ICD-9-CM Volume 3, we need two codes to get all of that information: one code for the lung transplant (33.51, unilateral lung transplant) and one for the donor source (00.93, transplant from cadaver).\r\n\r\nOne thing we don’t have in ICD-9-CM is the laterality. We don’t know which lung was involved. Why would that matter? Well, think about Frank’s future medical care. Perhaps he develops lung cancer. You’ll be able to tell whether it’s the transplanted lung or his own lung involved.\r\n\r\nMaybe Frank will need another lung transplant down the road (he’s a pretty unlucky guy). The physician will be able to tell whether he or she is replacing an original lung or a lung Frank picked up. That could provide information about the progression of the diseased that caused Frank’s need for a new lung in the first place. It could also provide information about the lifespan not just of the transplant recipient, but of the transplanted tissue itself.\r\n\r\nAnd all of that could (and hopefully will) lead to better treatment.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;',

		'body' : 'Ewww, I don’t think so. Your feet stink. What could be causing that foul odor to emanate from your feet?\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Feet.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-4135\" alt=\"Feet\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Feet-300x300.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a>The most common cause is sweat. Just sniff your old gym sneakers and you’ll see what I mean.\r\n\r\nSweat by itself is odorless, but when it comes into contact with bacteria it begins to smell bad. Usually, the bacteria are harmless, but some, such as necrotizing fasciitis, can eat through the skin.\r\n\r\nMaybe you have necrotizing fasciitis. How would we code that in ICD-10-CM?\r\n\r\nIf you look up fasciitis, necrotizing, in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index, you are directed to code M72.6. Pretty easy at first glance. We only have one code, so we don’t need to know what area the necrotizing fasciitis affected.\r\n\r\nWe do, however, need to use additional code (B95.-, B96.-) to identify causative organism. Is the necrotizing fasciitis caused by a form of Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, and Enterococcus or by some other bacterial agent, such as E. coli or Klebsiella pneumonia?\r\n\r\nCategories B95 and B96 do include unspecified options in case the physician doesn’t know whether the patient’s necrotizing fasciitis is caused by group A strep or group B strep. And you can use those unspecified codes. They are completely legitimate. The <i>ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting</i> even tell us that performing a medically unnecessary lab test just to arrive at a more specific code is inappropriate. (It’s guideline I.B.18 in case you’re interested.)\r\n\r\nPerhaps you have gangrene instead of necrotizing fasciitis. Gangrene reeks. The ICD-10-CM codes for gangrene are more specific than those for necrotizing fasciitis. We need to know where the gangrene is before we can code it.\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM does not include a separate listing for gangrene of the feet. It falls under gangrene of the upper and lower extremities, which leads to I96 (gangrene, not elsewhere classified).\r\n\r\nBefore you report I96, make sure you review the Excludes1 note. Excludes1 in ICD-10-CM means the two conditions are mutually exclusive. A patient can’t have both at the same time. Under I96, the Excludes1 note specifies:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Gangrene in atherosclerosis of native arteries of the extremities (I70.26)</li>\r\n	<li>Gangrene in diabetes mellitus (E08-E13)</li>\r\n	<li>Gangrene in hernia (K40.1, K40.4, K41.1, K41.4, K42.1, K43.1-, K44.1, K45.1, K46.1)</li>\r\n	<li>Gangrene in other peripheral vascular diseases (I73.-)</li>\r\n	<li>Gangrene of certain specified sites - see Alphabetical Index</li>\r\n	<li>Gas gangrene (A48.0)</li>\r\n	<li>Pyoderma gangrenosum (L88)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIf a patient suffers from atherosclerosis of native arteries of the extremities or diabetes mellitus, you may need to query the provider to make sure the two conditions aren’t causally related. In ICD-9-CM, we can assume a relationship between diabetes mellitus and gangrene if the physician does not document any other cause of the gangrene.\r\n\r\nCoders cannot report the combination codes for diabetes and a complication, such as gangrene, unless the physician specifically documents the relationship between the diabetes and the condition.\r\n\r\nMaybe the cause of your foul feet is something a little less life-threatening. You could just suffer from hyperhidrosis (aka sweaty feet).\r\n\r\nThe default code in ICD-10-CM is R61 (generalized hyperhidrosis). However, again we find some important Exludes1 notes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Focal (primary) (secondary) hyperhidrosis (L74.5-)</li>\r\n	<li>Frey\'s syndrome (L74.52)</li>\r\n	<li>Localized (primary) (secondary) hyperhidrosis (L74.5-)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese conditions are all more specific than the generalized hyperhidrosis.\r\n\r\nWhen excessive sweating affects the hands, feet, and armpits, it is called primary or focal (local) hyperhidrosis. Since we know the hyperhidrosis is of the feet, we would look to L74.5-.\r\n\r\nThe only code in this subcategory that applies is L74.513 (primary focal hyperhidrosis, soles). Again, the physician will need to documents that specific information in the medical record or you may need to query.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, might I suggest some extra strength Odor Eaters?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;',

Shannon and Wendy both went for the same apple and instead of a bite of juicy fruit, they cracked their heads together. Such a wailing you have never heard.\r\n\r\nThey both ended up with contusions (and Shannon inhaled some water), but otherwise, they’re fine.<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Pumpkin-scary.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-3634\" alt=\"Pumpkin scary\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Pumpkin-scary-300x238.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"238\" /></a>\r\n\r\nTo code their contusions, we need to know where they occurred. ICD-10-CM includes specific codes for contusions of the:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Forehead (S00.83-)</li>\r\n	<li>Ear (S00.43-)</li>\r\n	<li>Eyebrow (S00.1-)</li>\r\n	<li>Cheek (S00.83-)</li>\r\n	<li>Nose (nasal, S00.33-)</li>\r\n	<li>Jaw (S00.83-)</li>\r\n	<li>Scalp (S00.03)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou’ll notice code S00.83- shows up several times. It’s a not elsewhere classified code, specifically contusion of other part of the head. We know where the contusion occurred, we just don’t have a code for that specific body part.\r\n\r\nDon’t confuse that with the not elsewhere classified code, S00.93- (contusion of unspecified part of head). You will report S00.93- when the physician doesn’t tell you where the contusion occurred other than the patient’s head.\r\n\r\nWendy and Shannon smacked foreheads, so we would report S00.83XA (contusion of other part of head, initial encounter) for both.\r\n\r\nMake sure a ghost doesn’t make off with your placeholder X. S00.83A is not a valid ICD-10-CM code.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of ghosts making off with things, John decided to decamp with an entire pizza that was intended for the party. He consumed all of said pizza, making the evidence disappear—until he barfed it back up. (Yuck.

		'body' : 'Welcome to OR 13 at the Stitch ‘Em Up Hospital, where Dr. Hack N. Slash is preparing for today’s procedure. And what is today’s procedure? Dr. Slash is performing a cut down and suturing of a pseudoaneurysm.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_3480\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/09_Aneurysm.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-3480\" alt=\"Example of an aneurysm bulging out a blood vessel.\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/09_Aneurysm-300x173.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"173\" /></a> Example of an aneurysm bulging out a blood vessel.[/caption]\r\n\r\nOK, what’s that? Well, a pseudoaneurysm is a hematoma adjacent to a hole or other disruption of the arterial wall. If you know your Greek, you know that “pseudo” means false. An aneurysm is a balloon-like bulge in an artery. So instead of the pseudoaneurysm being a bulge in an artery, the blood is actually collecting outside the arterial wall. Not a good thing.\r\n\r\nA pseudoaneurysm is caused by blood slowly leaking into the surrounding tissue. It can happen pretty much anywhere you have an artery (which is pretty much everywhere in your body).\r\n\r\nPseudoaneurysms can also occur in the heart after damage from a heart attack causes blood to leak and pool outside the injured heart muscle.\r\n\r\nThe first thing we need to know is where the pseudoaneurysm is. That will give us our second character for our ICD-10-PCS code. The first character will be a 0 (zero, not a capital letter o) for the Medical and Surgical section. This is the biggest section of the <i>ICD-10-PCS Manual</i> and the one most non-OB coders will use the most.\r\n\r\nDr. Slash documents that the patient’s left leg is prepped and draped in a sterile fashion and he makes an incision to expose the femoral artery. That gives us lower artery as the body system (second character 4) and left femoral artery for the body part (fourth character L).\r\n\r\nBut we still need a third character, which is our root operation. What is the intent of this procedure? Well, Dr. Slash is attempting to remove blood from the patient’s leg, so maybe it’s Drainage (third character 9).\r\n\r\nICD-10-PCS defines Drainage as “taking or letting out fluids and/or gases from a body part.” Is Dr. Slash’s intention really just to remove the blood? Let’s check the OP report.\r\n\r\nUnder objective, Dr. Slash states he is suturing the artery to return it to its normal function. OK, so not Drainage. Dr. Slash’s objective isn’t to remove the blood flow. It’s to suture the hole in the artery to stop the leak. Which other root operation fits?\r\n\r\nTurns out, it\'s the “not elsewhere classified” (NEC) root operation Repair (restoring, to the extent possible, a body part to its normal anatomic structure and function).\r\n\r\nWe only use Repair (third character Q) when the method to accomplish the restoration is not one of the other root operations. That’s what makes it the NEC of root operations. If you’ve worked in the outpatient world at all, you are familiar with modifier -59 (distinct procedural service). You only append that modifier if no other modifier is more appropriate. Repair is the same way. You only report Repair when none of the other root operations describe the procedure.\r\n\r\nNow we can head to the table because we have our first three characters: 04Q.\r\n\r\nWe already know the body part, so our code so far is 04QL. Notice that we have a different body part for the right femoral artery, along with:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Abdominal aorta</li>\r\n	<li>Celiac artery</li>\r\n	<li>Gastric artery</li>\r\n	<li>Hepatic artery</li>\r\n	<li>Splenic artery</li>\r\n	<li>Superior mesenteric artery</li>\r\n	<li>Colic artery (right, left, and middle)</li>\r\n	<li>Renal artery (right and left)</li>\r\n	<li>Inferior mesenteric artery</li>\r\n	<li>Common iliac artery (right and left)</li>\r\n	<li>Internal iliac artery( right and left)</li>\r\n	<li>External iliac artery (right and left)</li>\r\n	<li>Popliteal artery (right and left)</li>\r\n	<li>Anterior tibial artery (right and left)</li>\r\n	<li>Posterior tibial artery (right and left)</li>\r\n	<li>Peroneal artery (right and left)</li>\r\n	<li>Foot artery (right and left)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThat is not by any means an exhaustive list of lower arteries, so we also have a body part character for “lower artery.”\r\n\r\nYou need to carefully read the body of the OP report to make sure the physician is actually performing the procedure he or she listed in the objective section. Sometimes surgeons need to change the procedure or sometimes they need to add a procedure.\r\n\r\nThe artery list is very specific, so if your surgeons are not this precise in their documentation, start working with them now on the added specificity. Chances are surgeons are documenting this somewhere in the OP report. You just may need to dig for it. (And make sure you scour the record before you fire off that query for location. No need to unnecessarily anger the surgeon.)\r\n\r\nBack to our code. We have three choices for the approach:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>0, open</li>\r\n	<li>3, percutaneous</li>\r\n	<li>4, percutaneous endoscopic</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nDr. Slash documented making an incision down to the artery to visualize the hole, so our approach is open (cutting through the skin or mucous membrane and any other body layers necessary to expose the site of the procedure).\r\n\r\nOur final two characters are a snap because we only have one option for each:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Z, no device</li>\r\n	<li>Z, no qualifier</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nOur final code is 04QL0ZZ (repair left femoral artery, open approach).\r\n\r\nAll that’s left now is to sew up the patient and send him off to recovery.',

		'body' : 'You may have noticed that the ICD-10 manuals have the word “draft” splashed all over them. (If you have an actual paper ICD-10 manual that is. The PDFs don’t include the word draft.)\r\n\r\nI had someone ask me about the word “draft.” She wanted to know when the draft designation would be removed so she could starting learning ICD-10.\r\n\r\nI asked her why she was letting the word draft stop her from learning ICD-10. She said she wanted to wait until the code sets were final before she started memorizing codes.\r\n\r\nI was, quite literally, speechless at that pronouncement.\r\n\r\nFirst, the code sets are never going to be final. We had yearly updates to ICD-9-CM even after we had been using it for 20 years. We’ll get yearly updates to ICD-10 starting one year after implementation. Medicine changes all of the time, and so do codes.\r\n\r\nSecond, that draft designation is not going away until we actually start using ICD-10. If you wait until October 1, 2015, to start learning ICD-10, you are in big trouble.\r\n\r\nThird, you should not be setting out to memorize codes. I know coders can recite codes they commonly use off the top of their heads. I have seen some very impressive displays of coding from memory. That doesn’t mean it’s a good thing. Did I mention that codes change? And so do coding guidelines. Also I’m not sure anyone sets out to memorize codes. It’s more a retention due to repeated use phenomenon. For example, I think every coder knows 250.00—diabetes unspecified. Not because we set out to learn, we’ve just seen it so many times.\r\n\r\nI’m not sure you could actually memorize most ICD-10 codes, especially the PCS codes. Good grief, some of those tables have a hundred possible combinations and you have to make sure you’re in the right row. I don’t know how you could keep everything straight.\r\n\r\nNo doubt coders will start picking up the diagnoses they report all of the time. Pretty soon everyone will know E11.9 (the ICD-10-CM version of 250.00).\r\n\r\nInstead of memorizing the codes, learn the concepts that ICD-10 is introducing. Make sure you understand what the seventh character represents and when you use an A, or a D, or an S. Check out the new guidelines (most are the same in ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM, but there are a few differences).\r\n\r\nIf you are an inpatient coder (or an outpatient coder who will be using ICD-10-PCS), you have a lot to learn. ICD-10-PCS is completely different from ICD-9-CM Volume 3. That’s not meant to scare you. For the most part, PCS makes sense. It’s just not what you’re used to doing. Get familiar with the information required to build a PCS code, then start reading through your physicians’ documentation to find out where that information is.\r\n\r\nStart a dialogue with your physicians and clinical documentation improvement specialists now to make sure everyone understands the new concepts in ICD-10. Work for an OB practice? You’ll need to start looking for weeks of gestation and make sure the docs are documenting it. Code orthopedics? You’ll need to brush up on your anatomy because the codes are much more specific. Be sure you tell the physicians they need to indicate a more detailed anatomical location if their current documentation isn’t detailed enough.\r\n\r\nWe have a lot of work to do in a shrinking time frame. Don’t let something like a draft designation derail your training and transition plans.',

In an address to the AMA’s House of Delegates November 9, Robert M. Wah, MD, president of the American Medical Society, once again showed how little physicians (at least those in leadership positions at physician societies) understand ICD-10.\r\n\r\nIn his remarks, Wah hyped the increased number of codes as a reason not to go to ICD-10. Sue Bowman, RHIA, CCS, senior director of coding policy and compliance for AHIMA in Chicago<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/2014/08/increased-specificity-leads-to-better-coding/\">, has pretty much blown that complaint out of the water</a>.\r\n\r\nAnd really, why does he care how many codes there are? We’re not asking physicians to code (please, stick to treating patients). We just want them to document what they did.\r\n\r\nWah also dragged out the tried-and-true “sucked into a jet engine” code complaint. Really? That’s the best you can do? An external cause code that is NOT required? How about the ability to tell which leg the patient broke? Probably a little more important–not only to physicians and payers--but also to any physician who treats that patient down the road.\r\n\r\nWant to improve the practice of medicine? Better data will help. Knowing that a particular injury is occurring more often, or a certain treatment works better, or even that more patients suffer delayed healing with a specific type of device will help physicians better treat patients, which is what they claim they want to do.\r\n\r\nSadly, Wah is not alone in his loathing for ICD-10. Right now, 24 members of Congress are physicians or members of the doctors’ caucus, according to Margarita Valdez, director of Congressional relations for AHIMA.\r\n\r\nThat group is solidly on board with Wah and the AMA, and firmly against ICD-10.\r\n\r\nAnd then we have Congress. Two bills to kill ICD-10 are still floating around and Valdez expects them to be reintroduced sometime after Congress convenes with its new session in January. Again, Congress members have no idea what ICD-10 is and isn’t and no idea why it’s better than the system we’ve been using for the past 30 years.\r\n\r\nHave I mentioned ICD-9-CM doesn’t have a code for Ebola? Funny how that disease keeps popping up. Wah may be proud of the AMA’s ability to delay ICD-10 for 10 years, but I’m not impressed. All the AMA is doing is <a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/2011/02/icd-10-factoid/\">putting us further behind</a> and holding back the practice of medicine. Make sure your voice is heard. <a href=\"http://www.house.gov/representatives/find/\">Bombard your members of Congress</a>.

		'body' : 'One of the biggest stumbling blocks for ICD-10 implementation by small physician practices was the estimated cost of the transition. Those costs may not be as high as originally estimated, according to an <a href=\"http://journal.ahima.org/wp-content/uploads/Week-3_PDFpost.FINAL-Estimating-the-Cost-of-Conversion-to-ICD-10_-Nov-12.pdf\">article in the <em>Journal of AHIMA</em></a>.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Money-hole-medium.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-4163\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Money-hole-medium-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"Money hole medium\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>Back in 2008, Nachimson Advisors estimated that small physician practices would spend a median of $83,000 to implement ICD-10.\r\n\r\nIn a 2014 update to the report, Nachimson Advisors upped those expected costs for a small physician practice to a wide-ranging estimate of $56,639‐$226,105.\r\n\r\nThe AMA has jumped all over those cost estimates in its ongoing quest to kill ICD-10. Small practices simply can’t afford that kind of investment, AMA claimed.\r\n\r\nThe new AHIMA report authored by a group of 3M consultants lowers the estimated implementation costs to $1,960-$5,900 for a three-physician practice with two impacted staff members, such as coders and or front desk/back office personnel.\r\n\r\nThat’s a considerable difference in costs. The article\'s authors go a step further and break down the costs as follows:\r\n\r\n<strong>Training</strong>: $50-$300 for three hours of online training in a particular specialty. Note they are talking specialty specific training, not general code set training, which makes sense. If you are a small pulmonary practice, you don’t need to know the changes for digestive diseases or orthopedic diagnoses. Comprehensive ICD-10 training for staff ranges from $350 to $700.\r\n\r\n<strong>Coding manual</strong>: Free to $70. Yes, you can download the ICD-10-CM and ICD-10-PCS Manuals from the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/icd/icd10cm.htm\">CDC</a> and <a href=\"http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/ICD10/2015-ICD-10-CM-and-GEMs.html\">CMS</a> websites at absolutely no cost. You may need to download multiple searchable PDFs to get all of the tables (neoplasm and drug) and the guidelines in addition to the codes, but still, it’s free. And because physician practices will still report procedures using CPT®, they don’t need the ICD-10-PCS Manual at all.\r\n\r\n<strong>Software upgrades</strong>: Free (maybe, it depends on the vendor). Many ICD-10 opponents bewailed the expected costs of converting software, billing systems, and electronic health records (EHR). How could a small physician practice possibly afford to implement an EHR, then update the entire thing for ICD-10? Turns out, many vendors are including the ICD-10 updates as part of their regular software updates, so the practice incurs no additional costs. Also, it’s a little deceptive to include the costs of implementing an EHR with the costs to implement ICD-10. You don’t have to have an EHR to use ICD-10. It will probably help and U.S. healthcare is moving more toward electronic records in general. An EHR will make the transition to ICD-10 easier, the article authors admit. However, they also state that many physician offices have received $44,000-$64,000 government incentive payments for implementing EHRs. The government, after all, is encouraging the healthcare industry to move to electronic records, hence the incentives for implementation and demonstrating meaningful use.\r\n\r\n<strong>Superbill conversion</strong>: A day’s worth of work. Physician practices that use superbills already update them yearly, so changing the superbill to ICD-10 is not significantly more involved, the authors state. In fact, most practices can complete the conversion in less than one day, they say. The bigger discussion may be whether to even continue to use a superbill. ICD-10-CM codes are much more detailed than ICD-9-CM codes, so a superbill could become too big to really be useful.\r\n\r\n<strong>End-to-end testing</strong>: Zero dollars. End-to-end testing is an important part of the ICD-10 implementation process. Complete and accurate documentation and accurate code assignment don’t do you any good if you can’t submit the claim. No claim submission, no reimbursement. End-to-end testing should allow providers to make sure they can submit claims and that the payer can accurately process the payment. Physicians generally don’t need to be involved in the testing. The office staff would handle that and even then, small practices will not incur costs for testing, according to the AHIMA article.\r\n\r\n<strong>Productivity declines and increased documentation requirements</strong>: Providers commenced major hand-wringing and offered apocalyptic predictions about documentation and productivity, especially when they looked at statistics from Canada. Canadian coders experienced a 50% decline in productivity immediately after ICD-10 implementation. In 2008, Nachimson estimated additional documentation costs for a small practice would be $44,000. No way can small practices afford that, the anti-ICD-10 faction wailed. However, that cost was based on data from inpatient hospitals. Physician practices still get to use CPT codes, so they don’t need to change their documentation for procedures. Inpatient hospitals will be using ICD-10-PCS codes, which are completely different from ICD-9-CM Volume 3 codes.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/question-marks.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-3095\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/question-marks-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"question marks\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a>The authors of the AHIMA article state, “New data in a large study in 2014 confirms physician practice progress when it reported that ‘a very large practice needed one hour or less for any necessary updating of documentation for the ICD-10 upgrade,’ illustrating that a number of practices have already established appropriate documentation practices well in advance of ICD-10 implementation.”\r\n\r\nI’m not sure I would go that far. I’m not sure physician documentation is all that great right now. Think about how many not otherwise specified or default codes you currently report. You will still have default codes in ICD-10-CM, but no one knows how long payers will accept a default code like E11.9 (the ICD-10-CM equivalent of everyone’s favorite unspecified diabetes code, 250.00). The <em>ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting</em> tell you it’s perfectly okay to report unspecified codes in some cases. Not all of the time though, and really laterality should never be unspecified. What’s the point in moving to a more specific code set if we aren’t capturing the more specific information?\r\n\r\nThe biggest cost associated with documentation is probably going to be auditing your current records and identifying what information is missing. Keep in mind, we aren’t trying to train physicians on how to code. We don’t want them coding. Instead of teaching them the codes, teach them the new concepts for ICD-10-CM: episode of care, laterality, weeks gestation (for OB). And keep it specific to what they aren’t doing now. If your physicians document laterality, don’t spend time telling them they need to document it.\r\n\r\nThe quality of the documentation will largely determine the loss in productivity for coders. The more time we have to spend querying, the longer it takes to drop the bill. And the longer it takes to get the reimbursement back in the door.\r\n\r\nThe new study is worth reading to see how they break down the costs, but remember every practice is going to be different. You can certainly use this information to allay some of your physicians’ fears about the costs of ICD-10 implementation.',

How would we code Jackman’s cancer? First we need to know what kind of cancer he’s had. Luckily for us, he’s told the world it’s basal cell carcinoma (BCC).\r\n\r\nBCC is the most common type of skin cancer, so in the Table of Neoplasms, we would look under skin. Not surprisingly, we see we need to know where on the skin his cancer was. Through the magic power of the Internet, we know it was on his nose—all three times.\r\n\r\nScanning down the many rows of skin cancer, we finally find nose, which gives us C44.301 (unspecified malignant neoplasm of skin of nose). Well, that’s not right. We know what kind of cancer it is.\r\n\r\nLet’s go back to the table and look up nose. Okay, we have lots of choices under nose, including skin. And under skin, we find a specific entry for BCC—C44.311 (basal cell carcinoma of skin of nose).\r\n\r\nThe Table of Neoplasms has six columns to describe the nature of the neoplasm (neoplasm does not equal cancer). You probably noticed, though, that BCC only has one possible code and it’s under Malignancy, primary. That’s because a carcinoma by definition is cancer.

Numerous conditions fall under G20, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Hemiparkinsonism</li>\r\n	<li>Idiopathic Parkinsonism or Parkinson\'s disease</li>\r\n	<li>Paralysis agitans</li>\r\n	<li>Parkinsonism or Parkinson\'s disease NOS</li>\r\n	<li>Primary Parkinsonism or Parkinson\'s disease</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIf the physician documents any of those terms, you’ll report G20.\r\n\r\nActor and comedian Robin Williams also suffered from Parkinson’s disease, as well as depression throughout his lifetime. He also reportedly suffered from delusions and/or hallucinations caused by Lewy bodies dementia.\r\n\r\nIf we look up dementia in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index, we find a large number of choices depending on the type of dementia. Lewy bodies show up twice in the list, first under the subterm “with,” then as a standalone entry, “Lewy bodies.” Both entries lead you to the same code, G31.83 (dementia with Lewy bodies).\r\n\r\nYou’ll also notice codes F02.80 (dementia in other diseases classified elsewhere without behavioral disturbance) and F02.81 (dementia in other diseases classified elsewhere with behavioral disturbance) appear in brackets after G31.83. The specific code depends on whether the patient is exhibiting behavioral disturbances, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Aggressive behavior</li>\r\n	<li>Combative behavior</li>\r\n	<li>Violent behavior</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWandering has its own code—Z91.83.\r\n\r\nCodes that appear in brackets in the Alphabetic Index are manifestation codes.\r\n\r\nCertain conditions have both an underlying cause and multiple body system manifestations due to that cause. In most cases, the manifestation codes will have in the code title, “in diseases classified elsewhere.” Codes with this title are a component of the etiology/manifestation convention.\r\n\r\n“In diseases classified elsewhere” codes cannot be the first-listed or principal diagnosis. You can only report them with the code for the underlying condition and you always report it after the underlying condition.\r\n\r\nNote that you would not code the delusions and/or hallucinations because they are an integral part of the dementia.',

He made a lot of money hitting the ball very, very far. I hope he saved some for his medical bills.\r\n\r\nIn October, Jose was cleaning a gun and accidentally shot off part of his left middle finger. According to Jose’s girlfriend, the finger was hanging on by a thread because Jose blew away an artery and a chunk of bone.\r\n\r\nIf we were to code Jose’s mishap, we would need some additional information. We already know the laterality and the specific finger. We also know it’s a partial amputation and it’s pretty traumatic. With that information, we can head to category S68 (traumatic amputation of wrist, hand, and fingers). Note that if the physician does not specify whether the amputation is complete or partial, you default to complete.\r\n\r\nThe next piece of information we need is where on the finger the partial amputation occurred. We have two choices:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S68.123-, partial traumatic metacarpophalangeal amputation of left middle finger</li>\r\n	<li>S68.623-, partial traumatic transphalangeal amputation of left middle finger</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe also need a seventh character to denote the encounter.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->We can also add some external cause codes to explain what happened to Jose:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>W32.0XXA, accidental handgun discharge, initial encounter (this was operator error, not a mechanical failure)</li>\r\n	<li>Y92.019, unspecified place in single-family (private) house as the place of occurrence of the external cause (We know from media reports that he was home, but we don’t know which room. Really, it doesn’t matter much for our purposes, but his insurance company may want to know.)</li>\r\n	<li>Y99.8, other external cause status</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe don’t know what specific treatment Jose had for his finger (I wasn’t interested enough to really dig in). So instead we’re going to look at how you would code a finger reattachment in ICD-10-PCS. For purposes of today’s post, we’re going to pretend Jose lost the whole finger (just make sure you don’t pretend or assume when you’re coding in the real world).\r\n\r\nWhen we code for reattaching a body part, we’re going to use root operation Reattachment. That makes sense.\r\n\r\nOur body system will be the upper extremities, which leads us to table 0XM.\r\n\r\nICD-10-PCS includes a body part character to each finger on each hand, so we know exactly which finger we’re dealing with. We’ll look for left middle finger, which gives us fourth character R. The rest of the code is a cakewalk because we only have one choice for each of the final three characters:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Open approach (0)</li>\r\n	<li>No device (Z)</li>\r\n	<li>No qualifier (Z)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThat makes our reattachment of the left middle finger code 0XMR0ZZ.\r\n\r\nSadly, Jose’s finger decided it didn’t want to stick around. Late last week, Jose noticed the finger was starting to smell bad. Um, Jose, that’s probably gangrene. You should go to a doctor.\r\n\r\nInstead, he went to a poker tournament in Las Vegas and claims the finger fell off. That probably falls under T87.2 (complications of other reattached body part). Note this is a not elsewhere classified code. We know the body part, we just don’t have a more specific code.\r\n\r\nWe also don’t have an external cause code for playing cards. Maybe they’ll add that in the first round of ICD-10-CM updates.',

He did actually shoot part of it off “cleaning” his gun and did indeed have it reattached. However, it’s still attached to his hand and not frozen for posterity (or future sale on eBay).\r\n\r\nWhy would Jose tell such a whopper? (NOTE: all of the suppositions in this post are just for fun and are not intended to be actual diagnoses of a specific individual. In other words, we’re pretending.)\r\n\r\nMaybe he suffers from F60.81 (narcissistic personality disorder). Individuals with narcissistic personality disorder grow up feeling superior and needing to be admired. They have a longstanding pattern of grandiosity (in fantasy or behavior), need for admiration, and lack of empathy. Well, he was an adored pro athlete. He wrote a book about steroids in baseball. He tried to one-up the Philae lander’s touchdown on a comet.\r\n\r\nAnother possibility is histrionic personality disorder, which is characterized by a pattern of excessive attention-seeking emotions. People with histrionic personality disorder have a high need for attention, make loud and inappropriate appearances, exaggerate their behaviors and emotions, and crave stimulation. That would dovetail nicely with his possible F63.0 (compulsive gambler).\r\n\r\nBy his own admission, Canseco used anabolic steroids during his playing days, so maybe he is suffering from T38.7X1- (anabolic steroid poisoning). Or perhaps he’s suffering consequences of F55.3 (steroid abuse).\r\n\r\nPerhaps Jose is really an F60.2 (pathological liar). Or maybe he has F07.81 (postconcussion syndrome) from the baseball that <a href=\"http://m.mlb.com/video/v13109513/jose-cansecos-moment-in-the-outfield-is-tops\">hit him in the head and bounced over the fence for a home run</a>. The F07.81 could also be a result of his foray into boxing and mixed martial arts.\r\n\r\nMost likely, though, he’s not suffering from any clinical condition. He just thought it would be funny.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;',

		'body' : 'In its November issue, the <em>Journal of AHIMA</em> <a href=\"http://journal.ahima.org/wp-content/uploads/Week-3_PDFpost.FINAL-Estimating-the-Cost-of-Conversion-to-ICD-10_-Nov-12.pdf\">published an article</a> citing significantly lower costs for physician practices to transition to ICD-10 than the numbers supplied by Nachimson Advisors <a href=\"http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/news/news/2014/2014-02-12-icd10-cost-estimates-increased-for-most-physicians.page\">in a 2014 updated report</a> (Nachimson published the first report at the request of the AMA in 2008).\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Money-hole-medium.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-4163\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Money-hole-medium-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"Money hole medium\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>We’re not talking about a small difference in cost estimates. Nachimson estimated small physician practices will spend $56,639-$226,105 on ICD-10 implementation. Analysts from 3M put the figure at $1,960-$5,900, according to the AHIMA article. Somebody’s numbers are way off.\r\n\r\nNachimson rebutted the AHIMA numbers, saying the study used to come up with the lower estimate is flawed and fails to account for some critical steps in ICD-10 planning and transition.\r\n\r\nSo who’s right? Probably neither. The real numbers will likely fall in the middle and could vary widely by practice. For example, a practice that already has a robust (or at least well-implemented) electronic medical record (EMR) will likely spend less time and money updating the system for ICD-10. The vendor should provide the software changes as part of the regular software updates.\r\n\r\nHowever, if a practice (or any other healthcare provider) does not have a good EMR in place that providers and coders are comfortable using, that organization will probably spend more time and money training on the software.\r\n\r\nHow much training is enough? Is it sufficient to just look at specialty specific codes? Probably not. The AHIMA article seemed to lowball the time needed for training coders. Physicians only need a few hours total to get up to speed on the concepts new to ICD-10.\r\n\r\nWhat we can’t afford is another ICD-10 delay. The AMA is continuing its quest to kill ICD-10 outright, while the <a href=\"http://www.texmed.org/Template.aspx?id=32347\">Texas Medical Association</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.mssny.org/MSSNY/Practice_Resources/ICD-10/ICD-10-Boehner-Letter.aspx\">Medical Society of the State of New York</a>, among others, are lobbying for at least another two-year delay.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->What would a two-year delay cost? Based on previous CMS estimates, between $2 billion and $13 billion. Who has that kind of money (other than Warren Buffett and Bill Gates)?\r\n\r\nThe medical associations claim the transition will cost $1.64 billion over 15 years, with 43% due to IT systems upgrades. They claim that physicians will bear the largest portion of the costs: $356 million for training and $571 million for expected productivity losses.\r\n\r\nThose numbers sound scary until you stop and think about them. That works out to $934.8 million over 15 years, which equates to $62.3 million a year. Now, spread that out among the roughly 230,000 physician practices in the United States and that works out to $271 a year per practice (if my math is correct).\r\n\r\nNow look at the $2 billion for a two-year delay. If we use the medical association’s claim that physicians will foot 57% of the costs, physician practices are looking at $570,000 in additional costs each year. That’s $2,478 per practice each year. That’s almost 10 times the cost if we implement ICD-10 in 2015 (if my math and logic hold). Plus we would still have those training costs and productivity declines to deal with.\r\n\r\nTraining is absolutely essential. If you don’t know how to code in ICD-10, you’re not getting paid, period, end of argument. However, physicians themselves will not be putting in endless hours of training. They will be spending more time documenting information so coders can report the most specific, applicable codes. But I would argue that they need to improve documentation now. Clinical documentation improvement wouldn’t <a href=\"http://trusthcs.com/growth-in-the-clinical-documentation-improvement-profession/\">be such a growing field</a> if physicians documented all of the information they need to document now.\r\n\r\nWe know productivity will decline, we just don’t know by how much. Almost all of the information about productivity declines centers on ICD-10-CM. No one else uses ICD-10-PCS. I think we’re going to see a big drop in productivity in the short-term just because no one is familiar with using PCS in the real world.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/question-marks.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-3439\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/question-marks-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"question marks\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a>How do we counter the AMA and physician practices (and everyone else dragging their feet)? Play up the benefits. Yes, ICD-10-CM includes 68,000 codes. But those codes provide physicians with a lot more information about the patient’s health. Say a patient broke his leg. In ICD-9-CM, we can tell if the fracture was open or closed and which part of the bone was broken. In ICD-10-CM, we’ll also know which leg and whether the patient is receiving active treatment, routine follow-up care, or suffering from a late effect.\r\n\r\nResearchers will be able to abstract more meaningful data and see what kinds of diseases or injuries are becoming more or less prevalent in the population. Right now, we can’t use coded data to track the number of patients in the U.S. with Ebola.\r\n\r\nICD-10-PCS is absolutely more complicated than ICD-9-CM Volume 3. And that’s a good thing. Right now, in ICD-9-CM Volume 3, we have one code for a closure of the skin and subcutaneous tissue of other sites (86.59). That doesn’t really tell you much.\r\n\r\nIn ICD-10-PCS, we’ll be able to specify where that closure was:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Scalp</li>\r\n	<li>Face</li>\r\n	<li>Anterior neck</li>\r\n	<li>Posterior neck</li>\r\n	<li>Chest</li>\r\n	<li>Back</li>\r\n	<li>Abdomen</li>\r\n	<li>Buttock</li>\r\n	<li>Perineum</li>\r\n	<li>Pelvic region</li>\r\n	<li>Right upper arm</li>\r\n	<li>Left upper arm</li>\r\n	<li>Right lower arm</li>\r\n	<li>Left lower arm</li>\r\n	<li>Right hand</li>\r\n	<li>Left hand</li>\r\n	<li>Right upper leg</li>\r\n	<li>Left upper leg</li>\r\n	<li>Right lower leg</li>\r\n	<li>Left lower leg</li>\r\n	<li>Right foot</li>\r\n	<li>Left foot</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nMore details? Absolutely. More work for the physicians? I hope not. They should already be documenting where they are performing a closure (especially if they want to get paid for their professional services). And, oh by the way, physicians will still be billing CPT® codes for procedures. Why do they even care that PCS is more complicated?\r\n\r\nThe physician organizations argue that the U.S. is the only country to tie coding to reimbursement. We’re also the last major industrialized country to keep limping along on the 30-year-old ICD-9 system. Yes, some physician practices will likely fold after ICD-10 implementation because either they aren’t ready or their payers aren’t ready.\r\n\r\nIf physician practices don’t prepare, they have only themselves to blame. Their readiness is completely under their control. ICD-10 isn’t a surprise. We were supposed to be using it in 2012. You’ve already had two extra years to get ready and you’re entering the third bonus year. What are you waiting for?\r\n\r\nIf it’s the payer’s fault, shame on them. You can (and should) find out know where your payers stand on ICD-10 readiness. And for the love of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, TEST your systems! Repeatedly. With every payer you can. (CMS is <a href=\"http://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/HIPAA-Administrative-Simplification/Affordable-Care-Act/End-to-End-Testing.html\">offering multiple testing weeks</a>, so sign up.) Getting the codes right does you no good if you can’t submit a claim or your payer can’t process it correctly.\r\n\r\nIf the physician groups want to lobby Congress, then so should the organizations that want ICD-10. Organizations and practices have already spent billions preparing for ICD-10. Let’s not waste more time and money.',

How would we code Tom’s procedures?\r\n\r\nLet’s start with the organ removal. Dr. Carver is removing the entire organs, so we know our root operation will be Resection.\r\n\r\nSo which body parts are we taking out of Tom? Well, let’s see. We don’t want the heart, lungs, liver, gizzard, gall bladder, crop, duodenum, ileum, jejunum, colon, and kidneys inside Tom.\r\n\r\nIn ICD-10-PCS, we would report a code for each separate body part. For example, if we are coding for the removal of Tom’s lungs, we would report code:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>0BTM0ZZ, Resection of bilateral lungs, open approach</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIf Dr. Carver only removed one lung, we would use either K (right lung) or L (left lung) as our fourth character.\r\n\r\nWe will do the same thing for the intestines. ICD-10-PCS includes separate body part values for the small intestine, as well as the duodenum, ileum, and jejunum. Because we are removing the entire small intestine, we would report 0DT80ZZ (Resection of small intestine, open approach).\r\n\r\nIf Dr. Carver removed part of Tom’s small intestine, we would use the body part character for the appropriate section:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>9, duodenum</li>\r\n	<li>A, jejunum</li>\r\n	<li>B, ileum</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<!--more-->Read the operative report carefully, not only to identify the correct body part, but also to make sure you choose the correct root operation. Dr. Carver may only remove a section of the ileum or duodenum. In that case, we would report the procedure using root operation Excision (cutting out or off, without replacement, a portion of a body part), not Resection.\r\n\r\nOnce Dr. Carver has completed the internal organ removal, it’s time to replace them with supplemental material (also known as stuffing).\r\n\r\nWhich root operation would we use to report stuffing Tom? Our possibilities include:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Insertion—putting in a non-biological appliance that monitors, assists, performs, or prevents a physiological function but does not physically take the place of a body part</li>\r\n	<li>Replacement—putting in or on biological or synthetic material that physically takes the place and/or function of all or a portion of a body part</li>\r\n	<li>Supplement—putting in or on biologic or synthetic material that physically reinforces and/or augments the function of a portion of a body part</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSince the stuffing is not really taking over the function of Tom’s missing body parts, it looks like Replacement is the closest match by intent. However, if you look at the ICD-10-PCS tables, you will notice that the tables for Replacement don’t include options for the complete organ. That makes sense because we don’t really have functioning artificial organs. And if the patient is receiving a new biologic organ, we would use root operation Transplantation (putting in or on all or a portion of a living body part taken from another individual or animal to physically take the place and/or function of all or a portion of a similar body part).\r\n\r\nIf we were putting in stuffing to help support one of Tom’s organs, we would use root operation Supplement. For example, if we were shoring up his large intestine with stuffing, we would report 0DUE0JZ (Supplement large intestine with synthetic substitute, open approach). I went with a synthetic substance since stuffing isn’t really a biological material.\r\n\r\nAgain, you need to identify the specific body part because we have body part characters for the:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Large intestine as a whole (E)</li>\r\n	<li>Right large intestine (F)</li>\r\n	<li>Left large intestine (G)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe also need to look for two other elements for this procedure:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>The approach</li>\r\n	<li>The supplemental material</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe approach can be:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Open (0)</li>\r\n	<li>Percutaneous endoscopic (4)</li>\r\n	<li>Via natural or artificial opening (7)</li>\r\n	<li>Via natural or artificial opening endoscopic (8)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe type of material could be:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Autologous tissue substitute (7), which comes from the patient</li>\r\n	<li>Synthetic substitute (J), which is not biologically derived</li>\r\n	<li>Nonautologous tissue substitute (K), which comes from someone other than the patient</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nOnce Dr. Carver sews up Tom, he’ll be ready for discharge to the oven, where we can roast him to perfection.',

Oh, the joys of group outings.\r\n\r\nOur first stop was the tiger enclosure, where a glass viewing window lets you get up close and personal with the rather large felines. One of the tigers decided it would be fun to play tag with the people and charged the glass. She pulled up in time to avoid giving herself a concussion, but she did send Andrea scrambling away from the glass.\r\n\r\nAndrea tripped over a rock and went sprawling. She ended up with lacerations on her palms and a scrapped right knee (her jeans didn’t fare well, either).\r\n\r\nEven though we aren’t at work, we’re going to code Andrea’s injuries anyway. We know we’re dealing with lacerations to the right and left hands, but is there any debris remaining in the wounds? Fortunately for Andrea, there isn’t. So our codes would be:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S61.411A, laceration without foreign body of right hand, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S61.412A, laceration without foreign body of left hand, initial encounter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<!--more-->For the knee injury, we need to know the same information. We know it’s the right knee and it looks like some small rocks are embedded in it. Our code for this injury is:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S81.021A, laceration with foreign body, right knee, initial encounter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAndrea is all cleaned up and we are off to the reptile house where Steve thought it would be a good idea to smuggle out a baby cobra. Baby cobra was not down with that plan, however, and sank its fangs into Steve’s left hand.\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM includes a plethora of codes for toxic animal bites, including one for a cobra. However, we do need some additional information. Was this accidental, intentional self-harm, assault, or undetermined?\r\n\r\nWell, the baby cobra definitely meant to assault Steve, but that’s not what ICD-10-CM means by assault. Assault would be Andrea throwing the cobra at Steve because he made fun of her fall.\r\n\r\nOur actual code would be T63.041A, toxic effect of cobra venom, accidental (unintentional), initial encounter.\r\n\r\nThe reptile house proved to be a very poor choice of place to visit. The Madagascar hissing cockroaches not only gave us all the creeps, they caused Jackee to hyperventilate and have an asthma attack.\r\n\r\nThe ICD-10-CM asthma codes look very different from their ICD-9-CM counterparts. ICD-10-CM divides asthma into these subcategories:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>J45.2-, mild intermittent asthma</li>\r\n	<li>J45.3-, mild persistent asthma</li>\r\n	<li>J45.4-, moderate persistent asthma</li>\r\n	<li>J45.5-, severe persistent asthma</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nEach subcategory includes these options:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Uncomplicated</li>\r\n	<li>With (acute) exacerbation</li>\r\n	<li>With status asthmaticus</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe also have a note in the ICD-10-CM Tabular List to use an additional code to identify:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (Z77.22)</li>\r\n	<li>Exposure to tobacco smoke in the perinatal period (P96.81)</li>\r\n	<li>History of tobacco use (Z87.891)</li>\r\n	<li>Occupational exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (Z57.31)</li>\r\n	<li>Tobacco dependence (F17.-)</li>\r\n	<li>Tobacco use (Z72.0)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAsthma also has both an Excludes1 (mutually exclusive) note and an Excludes2 (not included, but may also have) note. Be sure you check those when you code asthma.\r\n\r\nSadly, we’re going to have to call a halt to our zoo excursion for the day after we get Steve a fake snake from the gift shop.',

It seems like every day brings a new group trying to delay ICD-10 or another piece of legislation that ICD-10 opponents might slip delay language into.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/guy-with-question-marks-2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-3880\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/guy-with-question-marks-2-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"guy with question marks (2)\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>Multiple physician groups are campaigning for an additional two-year delay to push ICD-10 implementation to 2017.\r\n\r\nAHIMA, the Coalition for ICD-10, and AAPC, among others, are trying to mobilize a \"keep ICD-10 on track\" effort, calling on healthcare professionals to contact their members of Congress and lobby for no more delays.\r\n\r\n<strong>What to watch:</strong> Congress is in a lame-duck session for the rest of the year. The new Congress will be seated in January. Before then, however, Congress will likely vote on a $157 billion departments of Labor-Health and Human Services-Education spending bill. The bill would finance the departments for fiscal year 2015, which started in October.\r\n\r\nThe AMA, its regional societies, and delegations are reportedly working with Reps. Pete Sessions, R-Texas, chair of the House Rules Committee, and Fred Upton, R-Mich., chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, to add language to push out ICD-10 implementation by two years.\r\n\r\nThe language is not a done deal, though, and passage of the bill isn’t a sure thing either. It’s been bogged down in committee for six months.\r\n\r\nIf the AMA does not succeed with this appropriations bill, it will likely push hard to have two bills to kill ICD-10 reintroduced. Another Republican Texas representative, Ted Poe, introduced one of those bills, HR 1701, the Cutting Costly Codes Act, in April 2013. The other, S.972, the Cutting Costly Codes Act, was introduced in the Senate by Thomas Coburn, R-Okla., also in 2013. Republicans introduced both bills and the Republicans won control of Congress in the 2014 mid-term elections. However, they may not have enough support to get either bill out of committee.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->And last, but certainly not least, is the sustainable growth rate (SGR) patch. We all remember what happened <a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/2014/03/house-passes-bill-that-includes-icd-10-delay/\">with that bill in March</a>.\r\n\r\n<strong>What to remember</strong>: The AMA is the loudest lobbying group opposed to ICD-10. That doesn’t mean it’s the only group. It’s just the most visible one.\r\n\r\nThe other thing to keep in mind is that the AMA only represents approximately 30% of physicians. The other 70% are not members. While it’s easy to think most physicians don’t support ICD-10 because AMA is trying to kill it, that’s not necessarily the case.\r\n\r\n<strong>What we can do</strong>: AHIMA, AAPC, and the Coalition for ICD-10 are urging members to talk to their members of Congress, face-to-face if possible, and explain why we need ICD-10. (<a href=\"http://capwiz.com/ahima/callalert/index.tt?alertid=63889341\">Find your members of Congress here</a>.)\r\n\r\nIf you can’t (or just don’t want to) talk to your Congressional representatives, try some grassroots efforts in your own organization. Talk to your physicians, billers, coders, managers, case managers, CDI staff, HIM staff, C suite (if you can) and make sure your organization is on board. If they are, great. If they aren’t, educate and advocate.\r\n\r\nLet’s be as loud for ICD-10 as AMA has been against it.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;',

		'body' : 'Poor Finn. He’s heading for his first birthday, but he may not be in a partying mood. After Finn developed his fifth ear infection in six months, mom Melissa decided it was time to put tubes in his ears. Three days before his birthday. Bummer little dude, but this will be way better in the long run.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/crying-baby-e1340392061749.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-2827\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/crying-baby-300x253.jpg\" alt=\"crying baby\" width=\"300\" height=\"253\" /></a>In the real world, myringotomy is an outpatient procedure. It usually takes 10-15 minutes. However, for instructional purposes, we’re going to admit Finn to the Stitch ‘Em Up Hospital for his myringotomy.\r\n\r\nIn ICD-9-CM Volume 3, we would report code 20.01 (myringotomy with insertion of tube). What would this look like in ICD-10-PCS?\r\n\r\nWe know our first character will be 0 for the Medical and Surgical section of ICD-10-PCS. The second character is the body system. In this case, we’ll use 9 (ear, nose sinus).\r\n\r\nNow the fun part—determining the root operation. Coders get to choose the root operation (sorry, docs) based on the intent of the procedure. What is the purpose of putting tubes in Finn’s ears?\r\n\r\nThe idea behind a myringotomy is to drain excess fluid or pus from the middle ear, usually by making a small incision in the ear drum. The tympanostomy tubes keep the middle ear aerated for a few months or years to stop the fluid from building up again.\r\n\r\nSo the physician is putting in a tube to drain fluid. Insertion maybe? That might be your first guess, but ICD-10-PCS defines root operation Insertion as “putting in a nonbiological appliance that monitors, assists, performs, or prevents a biological function, but does not physically take the place of a body part.”\r\n\r\nThat doesn’t really match what our physician is doing. When you look at the root operation definitions, Drainage (taking or letting out fluids and/or gases from a body part) is a better fit.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->You can save yourself some time and aggravation by simply looking up myringotomy in the ICD-10-PCS Alphabetic Index. The index directs you to see Drainage, Ear, Nose, Sinus. It also helpfully directs us to table 099. And now things get very interesting.\r\n\r\nTable 099 takes up more than a page in the <em>ICD-10-PCS Manual</em>. That’s a lot of choices. In fact, one crosswalk listed 12 possible code equivalents to 20.01.\r\n\r\nThe first thing we need to do is determine the body part. Is the physician draining the middle ear or the tympanic membrane? Check the documentation. If you aren’t sure, query.\r\n\r\nIf the physician is draining the middle ear, we have two choices (and we’ll report both codes—one for the right ear and one for the left):\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>099500Z, drainage of right middle ear with drainage device, open approach</li>\r\n	<li>099600Z, drainage of left middle ear with drainage device, open approach</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWhy an open approach? First of all, it’s our only choice. That makes it pretty easy. But if you think about the procedure and the definition of an open approach (cutting through the skin or mucous membrane and any other body layers necessary to expose the site of the procedure), open makes sense. The physician is cutting through the tympanic membrane to drain the middle ear.\r\n\r\nYou do need to be careful with the table. We have two rows for drainage of right and left middle ear. One row has a device character 0 for drainage device (the tubes), the other lists no device. If the physician was simply draining the accumulated fluid without putting in tubes, we would use the codes with no device (09950ZZ, 09960ZZ).\r\n\r\nAnother thing to note is the qualifier. When the physician inserts a drainage device, the qualifier is Z (no qualifier). If the physician is simply draining the fluid, the seventh character can be X (diagnostic) or Z.\r\n\r\nThis is also a good time to stop and think about what ICD-10-PCS means by device. To be a device in ICD-10-PCS, it must remain in the patient after the physician completes the procedure. In Finn’s case, the tubes are staying in. Something like a temporary catheter, which is removed, does not count as a device in ICD-10-PCS.\r\n\r\nBack to our code possibilities. If the physician is actually draining the tympanic membrane, we have 10 codes to choose from (again, we’ll use two because both ears are getting tubes).\r\n\r\nThe difference between the codes comes down to the approach. We have five possible approaches:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Open</li>\r\n	<li>Percutaneous: entry, by puncture or minor incision, of instrumentation through the skin or mucous membrane and any other body layers necessary to reach the site of the procedure</li>\r\n	<li>Percutaneous endoscopic: entry, by puncture or minor incision, of instrumentation through the skin or mucous membrane and any other body layers necessary to reach and visualize the site of the procedure</li>\r\n	<li>Via natural or artificial opening: entry of instrumentation through a natural or artificial external opening to reach the site of the procedure</li>\r\n	<li>Via natural or artificial opening endoscopic: entry of instrumentation through a natural or artificial external opening to reach and visualize the site of the procedure</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nKeep in mind the surgeon is probably not going to say, “I used a percutaneous endoscopic approach.” You’ll need to carefully read the operative report and determine which approach the surgeon used.\r\n\r\nIf you commonly code surgery (which most inpatient coders do), you can ask your surgeons to do some short educational sessions to explain how they perform specific procedures. Work with them now so when we get to ICD-10-PCS you won’t query them for information that’s already in the record.',

		'body' : 'Usually in this blog, I talk about ICD-10 implementation and coding from the coder or HIM point of view. But I wanted to share some suggestions from James S. Kennedy, MD, CCS, CDIP, president of <a href=\"http://www.cdimd.com\">CDIMD – Physician Champions</a> in Smyrna, Tennessee. You’ll notice that Dr. Kennedy is not only a physician, he also holds coding and CDI credentials.\r\n\r\nRecently, Dr. Kennedy wrote a column for our sister publication, <em><a href=\"http://www.hcpro.com/publication-newsletter-140-department-health-information-management.html\">Medical Records Briefing</a></em>, about ICD-10 implementation. It’s a great piece (as Dr. Kennedy’s columns always are) and gives us a view from the physician side of the debate.\r\n\r\nDr. Kennedy emphasizes that he’s not against ICD-10; however, he is concerned that the way ICD-10 is constructed, managed, and being implemented creates undue burden for physician practices and that, unless addressed, will give physician groups ammunition to convince Congress to delay its implementation for another two years, if not forever. <a href=\"http://www.texmed.org/Template.aspx?id=32347\">Witness statements recently made by the Texas Medical Association</a> that do just that.\r\n\r\nGiven that ICD-10 is a political football, Kennedy believes that a deal can be struck between organized physician groups such as the AMA and <a href=\"http://www.coalitionforicd10.org\">the Coalition</a> for ICD-10 that:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Engages physicians in ICD-10’s governance</li>\r\n	<li>Simplifies ICD-10 documentation and coding requirements</li>\r\n	<li>Reduces claim denials</li>\r\n	<li>Enhances the utility of the ICD-10 datasets essential to health planning, reimbursement, and outcomes measurement</li>\r\n	<li>Guarantees an implementation date</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWhat I wanted to share are Dr. Kennedy’s negotiating points, things that the AMA, medical specialty societies, and the Coalition for ICD-10 can use to make implementation better for everyone.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->Kennedy: Ask your specialty society to advocate with Congress for a fifth Cooperating Party for ICD-10 to represent physician interests so that we can have a direct say in the maintenance of ICD-10. This will also promote the physician-coder partnership in the <em>ICD-10 Official Guidelines</em>, ensuring a level playing field.\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>My two cents: Why don’t physicians have a seat at the table? We’ve complained for years about Recovery Auditors not using clinical people to review records. Having a physician presence among the Cooperative Parties would benefit everyone.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nKennedy: Call your congressional representatives to ask that the ICD-10 documentation requirements be loosened such that a competent coder can clinically interpret the record within reasonable parameters and assign a defendable code, preventing a payer or Recovery Auditor from denying reimbursement when the circumstances are obvious.\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>My two cents: I love this idea. I do think we need to be careful about making sure the coding professional is competent, but the coding professional organizations can surely create a certification. Coders who have been on the job for a number of years probably have a pretty good idea of what certain clinical information means.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nKennedy: Partner with your hospitals to ask the Cooperating Parties to let coders and clinical documentation improvement specialists be more direct with what they need from us in real time, instead of playing “20 questions” to get the exact ICD-10-based documentation supporting the correct code.\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>My two cents: Fantastic idea! Let’s make the work easier for everyone. Coders and CDI specialists get frustrated when they can’t get the physician to give them the words they need. Physicians get fed up with endless queries about things they believe they have already documented. Make it easier for everyone and reduce the frustration and animosity.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nKennedy: Advocate with your EHR companies to develop ICD-10-oriented clinical documentation templates and tools promoting problem-oriented charting (especially in the problem list), emphasizing the ability to link conditions to each other (e.g., fractures with osteoporosis, congestive heart failure with cardiomyopathies) and to express uncertainty or working diagnoses (e.g., pneumonia likely due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) where appropriate.\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>My two cents: Clinicians (physicians, nurses, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, etc.) are the ones who need to work the most in the EHR. I’ve heard various other people speak about EHR improvements to make the transition to ICD-10 easier. Physicians will need to document specific information for ICD-10 codes. Make it easier for them, but include them in the conversation. Get a group of physicians, coders, and CDI specialists together. Look at your top codes by volume and by money. What information will you need in ICD-10 for these codes? What templates can you ask your vendor to build? If you have a physician willing to work with the vendor, get them together so the physician can explain to the vendor what would make sense from a clinical standpoint. Is there a prompt that can be added? Or if you’re building a template, where should the information be located to make it easy for the clinician?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nKennedy: Tell the ICD-10 Coalition (which includes Blue Cross) that it must publish its ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM crosswalks and medical necessity criteria as a condition of our acceptance of ICD-10 so that our claims are not denied just because we unwittingly documented or used an unspecified code.\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>My two cents: I’m a little worried about the payers’ refusal to publish their ICD-9-CM to ICD-10 crosswalks and ICD-10-based medical necessity criteria. CMS has had both ICD-10-CM and ICD-10-PCS GEMs out for years and is publishing ICD-10-based medical necessity criteria on its website. One of the problems with crosswalks is they aren’t a one-to-one comparison. If they were, why bother moving to a new code set? Crosswalks aren’t perfect. They are only as good as the people who created them and the work put into building them. If we have the crosswalks in advance, we might be able to find places where we think the code assignment isn’t correct (assuming of course you have time to look at the crosswalk and compare the codes). Also, in some cases, an unspecified code is perfectly legit. The physician don’t always know the causative organism. An outpatient physician may not know at the time of the encounter where a fracture is or which ligament is sprained. Granted I think you should never report unspecified laterality, but odds are physicians are already documenting that.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese are great points to consider not only for physicians, but for coders and HIM as well. Work with your physicians to find out what you and they can do to make the transition better for everyone.',

How…nice.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Partridge-in-a-pear-tree.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-4198\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Partridge-in-a-pear-tree-178x300.jpg\" alt=\"Partridge in a pear tree\" width=\"178\" height=\"300\" /></a>Fortunately, the tree is way too big for the living room (it also clashes with my real Christmas tree). The pear tree is potted, so out it goes to the patio.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Mr. Whiskers spotted the partridge before I could get the pear tree out of the house. Mr. Whiskers thinks the bird is his Christmas present. (Not that he should get presents. He’s been a bad kitty.)\r\n\r\nMr. Whiskers prepared a sneak attack on his presumed snack, but the partridge was prepared. It launched a barrage of pears at the cat as he attempted to climb the tree. (The bird couldn’t have just relocated?)\r\n\r\nSadly the bird’s aim was a little off (which is only to be expected when one is hurling pears with talons) and Mr. Whiskers escaped unscathed (but motivated to devise a new plan). One of the projectile pears did find a target—it hit my true love right between the eyes. Oh, honey, that looked like it hurt. (Maybe the bird’s aim isn’t so bad after all.)\r\n\r\nMy true love suffered a contusion of the forehead. In ICD-10-CM, we would report S00.83XA (contusion of other part of head) for the initial encounter. You’ll notice the placeholder X to make sure the seventh character is in the seventh position. It doesn’t matter if you capitalize the X or not when you report the code on the claim.\r\n\r\nYou’ll also notice the code description states, “other part of the head.” Underneath the code are these two included conditions:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Bruise of other part of head</li>\r\n	<li>Hematoma of other part of head</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nOther part of the head does not mean this is an unspecified code. We know the part of the head involved. We just don’t have a code for it. This is a “not elsewhere classified” code, not a “not otherwise specified” code.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->ICD-10-CM does include unspecified codes and in some cases you are perfectly justified in using them. Just don’t report S00.90- (unspecified superficial injury of unspecified part of head). If the physician can’t document the type of injury and the location, the payer is probably not going to reimburse you for treatment. Odds are, physicians are already documenting location and type of injury. We may just need to dig a little to find it.\r\n\r\nFor a head injury, even a bruise from being hit by a pear, we should also look for any associated fracture and/or brain injury, such as a concussion. My true love got off easy. The bird doesn’t have Nolan Ryan’s arm, er, talon strength.\r\n\r\nWe can also assign some additional external cause codes. You don’t need to report external cause codes for every case. You only need them if the payer requires them. If you don’t report external cause codes now, you won’t report them in ICD-10-CM.\r\n\r\nFor my true love’s run in with his present, we could add:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>W20.8XXA, other cause of strike by thrown, projected or falling object, initial encounter (you could also consider Y00.XXXA, assault by blunt object, initial encounter. After all, the bird was throwing pears with a purpose.)</li>\r\n	<li>Y92.017, garden or yard in single-family (private) house as the place of occurrence of the external cause (the patio is part of the yard at our house)</li>\r\n	<li>Y99.8, other external cause status</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nMaybe that will teach him not to bring a bird into a cat’s house.',

Apparently not. And apparently Mr. Whiskers isn’t hungry for doves. He barely spared them a glance. He’s just staring out the window at the partridge.\r\n\r\nPerhaps my true love is going for the symbolic with this gift. Turtle doves mate for life.\r\n\r\nWell, they are kind of cute, but the cuddling is getting a little out of hand. So is that turr-turr sound they make.\r\n\r\nMy true love decided he should feed the doves because nothing takes the mind off cuddling like food. (At least in my true love’s opinion.)\r\n\r\nWhat do turtle doves eat? Seeds. And there are now seed pods all over the floor. Here you go, true love, a broom and dust pan to clean up after the birds.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->Maybe expecting my true love to clean up wasn’t such a good idea. The doves apparently don’t love him. In fact, they’re spitting seeds at him. One, make that two, just landed in his eye.\r\n\r\nNow in addition to sporting a large bruise on his head from the partridge’s projectile pear, he also has a scratched cornea courtesy of his lovey-dovey birds.\r\n\r\nIf you look up “scratch” in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index, it directs you to see abrasion. Abrasion of the cornea leads us to code S05.0- (injury of conjunctiva and corneal abrasion without foreign body). That dash tells us the code requires additional characters. Any ideas what those characters could represent?\r\n\r\nIf you said laterality, you win a turtle dove. (Please take them before the cat gets bored watching the partridge and decides the doves will do instead.)\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM includes three code choices under S05.0-:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S05.00-, injury of conjunctiva and corneal abrasion without foreign body, unspecified eye</li>\r\n	<li>S05.01-, injury of conjunctiva and corneal abrasion without foreign body, right eye</li>\r\n	<li>S05.02-, injury of conjunctiva and corneal abrasion without foreign body, left eye</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe’ll also need an X placeholder and a seventh character to denote the encounter as:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>A, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>D, subsequent encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S, sequela</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou may also have noticed the Excludes1 note under S05.0-:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Foreign body in conjunctival sac (T15.1)</li>\r\n	<li>Foreign body in cornea (T15.0)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIf my true love wasn’t smart enough to remove the seeds from his eye before going to the doctor, we would use one of the T codes (which also require laterality and a seventh character).\r\n\r\nI can hardly wait to see what he brings tomorrow.

My house is starting to look like an aviary. I’m also not sure why my true love thought it necessary to import hens. What to do with the hens?\r\n\r\nWell, it seems little Cindy Lou has decided to play tag with the hens. The birds don’t seem to be enjoying the game nearly as much as the 2-year-old. I wonder why they don’t just fly off?\r\n\r\nI spoke too soon. The birds have taken flight and Cindy Lou thought she could too. She just jumped off the couch flapping her arms in imitation of the French ladies. Not surprisingly, she didn’t do as well. She just hit the floor and commenced wailing. I guess we should see what sort of injuries she has incurred.\r\n\r\nFortunately, the couch wasn’t high off the ground and Cindy Lou is sort of an expert at falling. Did I mention she’s 2?\r\n\r\nOther than some minor bumps and bruises (and a good scare), she seems to be OK. And then she stood up and immediately crumpled to the ground with a fresh screech and more tears. Cindy Lou did not stick a perfect landing after all.\r\n\r\nWhat misfortune befell our little angel? Did she break her ankle? Sprain her ankle? Heaven forbid, dislocate her ankle?\r\n\r\nDr. Joe at the Acme ED believes she just sprained her ankle. He is sending her for a rule-out x-ray just to be sure.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nIf we code this ED visit before Dr. Joe has the results of the x-ray, we can’t code a sprained ankle. Dr. Joe hasn’t made a definitive diagnosis and in the outpatient (including the ED) world, we can only code definitive diagnoses. If Dr. Joe (or any doc) uses words such as “suspected,” “probable,” or “rule out,” we can only code the symptoms.\r\n\r\nThe Acme x-ray tech is quick today (probably to avoid spending too much time with a screaming toddler) and we know before we leave that Cindy Lou indeed has a sprained ankle. So long symptom codes, we have a definitive diagnosis. Or most of one. We still need to know which ligament wasn’t up to serving as landing gear.\r\n\r\nDr. Joe documents an inversion sprain of the anterior talofibular ligament. Make sure you don’t confuse the talofibular ligament with the tibiofibular one. You’ll end up with the wrong code.\r\n\r\nOur trusty Alphabetic Index informs us that the talofibular ligament falls under “specified ligament NEC.” When we check the Tabular List under S93.49- (sprain of other ligament of ankle), we do indeed find the talofibular ligament as well as the internal collateral ligament. For the an initial encounter for a sprain of the left talofibular ligament, we would report S93.492A.\r\n\r\nNEC means not elsewhere classified, so we have information but not a specific enough code. (Turns out ICD-10-CM does not have a very detailed, specific code for everything.)\r\n\r\nAfter an elastic bandage, some ice, and admonitions not to try to fly with the French hens (or reindeer for that matter), we are on our way back home to see what our feathered friends have been up to in our absence.',

Or maybe he captured these in the park. He says they’re calling birds. They look more like blackbirds to me.\r\n\r\nAnd they act like blackbirds. Right now they are fighting for the prime nesting spot in my Christmas tree. More alarmingly, Mr. Whiskers has abandoned his partridge vigil to try and catch the calling birds.\r\n\r\nMy true love better put a stop to that, but alas, numbers more than made up for the size disparity, especially when Mr. Whiskers turned on my true love.\r\n\r\nIn an effort to flee his feathered and feline attackers, my true love tripped over the coffee table. He made a valiant effort to keep his balance, but just before he could completely right himself, he crashed into the glass sliding door to the patio. Make that crashed <em>through</em> the glass sliding door.\r\n\r\nMy true love lives a charmed life, however, and suffered only lacerations from the glass. How he managed that, I will never know.\r\n\r\nHow would we code his misfortune this time? ICD-10-CM groups injuries by body area instead of type of injury. So we can’t turn to a category of codes and find all of the laceration codes. Instead, we’ll find lacerations grouped with all of the other injuries to the hand or leg or whichever body part is affected.\r\n\r\nFor example, my true love suffered lacerations to his right forearm (thankfully he missed the big arteries). We would look up laceration, forearm in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index. If you look up laceration, arm, the index specifies upper arm.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->We need some additional information to report the appropriate code. First is laterality (you’re shocked, I know). Next we need to know if any foreign body remained in the wound. ICD-10-CM includes separate codes for with and without foreign body.\r\n\r\nIf my true love had some lacerations with foreign body and some without, we would report different codes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S51.811A, laceration without foreign body of right forearm, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S51.821A, laceration with foreign body of right forearm, initial encounter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nMake sure you don’t forget the seventh character. S51.811 is not a valid ICD-10-CM code. The seventh character denotes the encounter, and for laceration codes we have three choices:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>A, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>D, subsequent encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S, sequela</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSome antiseptic and Band-Aids should fix my true love right up and he can clean up the mess he (and the birds and the cat) made.',

		'body' : 'On the fifth day of Christmas my true love gave to me five golden rings. Hey wait, there are only four rings here. Where did the other one go?\r\n\r\nOh no, little Andrew shoved it up his nose.<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Five-gold-rings.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-4227\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Five-gold-rings-163x300.jpg\" alt=\"Five gold rings\" width=\"163\" height=\"300\" /></a>\r\n\r\nTime to remove the ring from the child’s nose and then disinfect it (kid boogers—gross).\r\n\r\nIf we are removing something in ICD-10-PCS, which root operation would we use? (Keep in mind, ICD-10-PCS is really for inpatient procedures. Outpatient facilities and physicians will still use CPT®. But this is a fun exercise.)\r\n\r\nICD-10-PCS does feature root operation Removal. Fortunately for Andrew, pulling a ring out of his nose does not meet the ICD-10-PCS definition of Removal. In ICD-10-PCS, we only use Removal for taking out or off a device from a body part. No device, no Removal.\r\n\r\nWhat other root operations could it be? Extraction perhaps? ICD-10-PCS defines Extraction as “pulling or stripping out or off all or a portion of a body part by the use of force.” That ring is not a body part so we can eliminate Extraction.\r\n\r\nHow about Extirpation? I’ve always wanted to code Extirpation. The ICD-10-PCS definition of Extirpation is “taking or cutting out solid matter from a body part.” The ring is solid matter (at least it better be).\r\n\r\nThe ICD-10-PCS Reference Manual provides the following additional information about Extirpation:\r\n\r\n<em>The solid matter may be an abnormal byproduct of a biological function or a foreign body; it may be imbedded in a body part or in the lumen of a tubular body part. The solid matter may or may not have been previously broken into pieces.</em>\r\n\r\nWinner! Extirpation it is. Our table in ICD-10-PCS is 09C.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->When we look at that table, we see we have a lot of choices for the body part:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Nasal turbinate</li>\r\n	<li>Nasopharynx</li>\r\n	<li>Mastoid sinus, right</li>\r\n	<li>Mastoid sinus, left</li>\r\n	<li>Nasal septum</li>\r\n	<li>Accessory sinus</li>\r\n	<li>Maxillary sinus, right</li>\r\n	<li>Maxillary sinus, left</li>\r\n	<li>Frontal sinus, right</li>\r\n	<li>Frontal sinus, left</li>\r\n	<li>Ethmoid sinus, right</li>\r\n	<li>Ethmoid sinus, left</li>\r\n	<li>Sphenoid sinus, right</li>\r\n	<li>Sphenoid sinus, left</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe also have a nice, generic body part, nose (K). Guess which one we’re going to use. Yep, the nice generic nose. Why? Well, we know from anatomy class that Andrew could not have shoved the ring into his sinuses.\r\n\r\nHe could possibly have pushed the ring back into his nasopharynx (the part of the pharynx above the soft palate that is continuous with the nasal passages). But when you think about what the physician will be doing, nose is the best choice.\r\n\r\nThat gives us 09CK as the first four characters of our code.\r\n\r\nOn to the approach. We have four possibilities:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>0, open</li>\r\n	<li>3, percutaneous</li>\r\n	<li>4, percutaneous endoscopic</li>\r\n	<li>X, external</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nOur lives would be much easier if the physician would say, “I used a percutaneous approach.” But they probably won’t, so we need to know what is involved with each approach and look for key words in the documentation.\r\n\r\nIf the doctor is pulling out a ring from Andrew’s nose, he or she is most likely using an external approach.\r\n\r\nICD-10-PCS Coding Guideline B5.3a states that procedures performed within an orifice on structures that are visible without the aid of any instrumentation are coded to approach value X.\r\n\r\nFor percutaneous and percutaneous endoscopic approaches, the physician makes an incision or punctures the skin. An open approach requires cutting through skin. If the physician is using a pair of really long tweezers to pull out the ring, external is the best choice.\r\n\r\nOur final two characters are easy because we only have one choice for each: no device and no qualifier.\r\n\r\nThat makes the final code 09CKXZZ (Extirpation of matter from nose, external approach).\r\n\r\nNow that Andrew is all taken care of and the ring is disinfected, I’m going to put it with the others to have a nice matched set. Only I can’t find the other rings. If those birds took them, they’re dinner!',

Bad idea, Uncle Ted. The geese were so outraged by Uncle Ted’s presumption that they attacked en masse.\r\n\r\nLuckily for Uncle Ted, geese don’t have teeth so he only ended up with lots of bruises from goose beaks. In ICD-10-CM, we will report a separate code for each bite site, so if the geese bit his right forearm, left lower leg, and his right pinkie, we would report:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S50.871A, other superficial bite of right forearm, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S80.872A, other superficial bite, left lower leg, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S60.476A, other superficial bite of right little finger, initial encounter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nNote that all of these codes require a seventh character for the encounter. They are all also “other specified” codes. We know what bit Uncle Ted, but since it was not an insect, we go with “other specified.”\r\n\r\nWe can add some external cause codes to further flesh out Uncle Ted’s travails:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>W61.51XA, bitten by goose, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>Y92.010, kitchen of single-family (private) house as the place of occurrence of the external cause</li>\r\n	<li>Y99.8, other external cause status</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nOnly the first code requires a seventh character to specify the encounter, so don’t add As to the other codes. They’ll be invalid.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->If the geese had left Uncle Ted with open wounds, for example if they had teeth, we would report a different set of codes. ICD-10-CM differentiates between superficial and open bites.\r\n\r\nA few geese love bites didn’t deter Uncle Ted from trying for some fresh eggs for breakfast, so the geese were forced to take more drastic action. The gaggle ganged up to herd Uncle Ted to the fireplace where one of the geese pushed a stone elf off the shelf and onto Uncle Ted’s foot. In addition to killing the elf, the impact also crushed Uncle Ted’s left foot.\r\n\r\nFor the crushed foot, we would report S97.82XA (crushing injury of left foot, initial encounter). If the falling elf crushed any toes, we would report an additional code (S09.11-) for the great toe and one code (S97.12-) for any and all lesser toes crushed.\r\n\r\nUncle Ted will be spending the holidays on crutches and he has now sworn off eggs of all sizes and shapes.

One swan with poor navigation skills flew right into Chuckie, sending him tumbling and screaming into the really cold pond.\r\n\r\nMy true love did his best superhero impersonation, wading into the pond to fish out Chuckie. The water was cold, but not very deep. My true love deposited the spluttering child on the bank where his sister Ruth proceeded to mock him for falling into the water. A sibling slugfest ensued with both kids ending up in the pond.\r\n\r\nChattering teeth resolve family disputes and Chuckie and Ruth are back to being friends.

The enthusiastic petting by the children isn’t helping either.\r\n\r\nTommy, I don’t think you should be walking behind that cow. Tommy, seriously, don’t walk behind that…oh, he walked behind the cow and the cow kicked him in the side of the head.\r\n\r\nOff to the Acme ED we go with an unconscious 6-year-old and his hysterical mother.\r\n\r\nFortunately, Tommy is awake by the time we arrive at the ED 20 minutes later. Dr. Joe diagnoses a concussion and a fractured parietal bone. Fortunately, Tommy has a hard head and suffered no brain injury beyond the concussion.\r\n\r\nTo find the code for the fracture of the parietal bone, you can look up either <em>Fracture, skull, parietal</em>, or just <em>Fracture, parietal</em> in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index. Both lead you to code S02.0-.\r\n\r\nWhen you head to the Tabular List, you see that S02.- is a fracture of the vault of the skull and includes both the parietal and frontal bones.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->For skull fractures, we don’t need to know laterality or whether the fracture is displaced. We do need to know whether the fracture is open or closed. If the physician doesn’t specify, we default to closed. So our code for the skull fracture is S02.0XXA (fracture of the vault of the skull, initial encounter). Be sure you don’t forget the two X placeholders. Otherwise the seventh character ends up in the wrong place and the code is invalid.\r\n\r\nCategory S02 also includes a note to code any associated intracranial injuries, which includes Tommy’s concussion.\r\n\r\nFor the concussion, we need to know how long Tommy was unconscious. Since his loss of consciousness was less than 30 minutes, we would report S06.0X1A (concussion with loss of consciousness of 30 minutes or less, initial encounter).\r\n\r\nDr. Joe assures Tommy’s mom that he will be just fine in a few days and we happily depart the Acme ED.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile back at the house, the cat is limping and the patio is littered with exploded pear parts.

Don’t be tempted to just skip ahead to the Tabular List and look for the best code. You can’t code shop in the Tabular List no matter how tempting it might be.\r\n\r\nOur final fallen lord, Alfred, pulled a hamstring. Sprain or strain?\r\n\r\nA sprain involving stretching or tearing a ligament (tissue that connects bone to bone) or a joint capsule. Not a hamstring then.\r\n\r\nStrains involve stretching or tearing of a musculo-tendinous (muscle and tendon) structure. That sounds like a hamstring.\r\n\r\nIn the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index, under <em>Strain, muscle</em>, it tells us to <em>see Injury, muscle, by site, strain</em>.\r\n\r\nHere’s where you need to know your leg muscle anatomy. Under <em>Injury, muscle, leg</em>, we do not have codes for a strain of the hamstring. Instead, the index lists:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Anterior muscle group</li>\r\n	<li>Peroneal muscle group</li>\r\n	<li>Posterior muscle group</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe hamstring is a group of muscles located on the back of your thigh, which most coders probably know. It is comprised of four muscles:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Biceps femoris</li>\r\n	<li>Semimembranosus</li>\r\n	<li>Semitendinosus</li>\r\n	<li>Adductor magnus (at least part of it)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe quadriceps (a group of four muscles on the front of your thigh) have their own code, as do these other thigh muscles:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Adductor brevis muscle</li>\r\n	<li>Adductor longus muscle</li>\r\n	<li>Adductor minimus muscle</li>\r\n	<li>Gracilis muscle</li>\r\n	<li>Pectineus muscle</li>\r\n	<li>Sartorius muscle</li>\r\n	<li>Tensor fasciae latae muscle</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIf you code for orthopedic injuries, you need to know where each of these muscles is located. Otherwise you won’t know to code Alfred’s hamstring strain using either:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S76.311-, strain of muscle, fascia and tendon of the posterior muscle group at thigh level, right thigh</li>\r\n	<li>S76.312-, strain of muscle, fascia and tendon of the posterior muscle group at thigh level, left thigh</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nEach code requires a seventh character for the encounter.\r\n\r\nBe careful with the muscles. ICD-10-CM does include codes for some specific muscles of the thigh, such as:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Adductor (but no more specificity than that)</li>\r\n	<li>Quadriceps</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe rest fall into general groups.\r\n\r\nFortunately all of our lords survived the mash up without breaking any bones. Maybe we can pair them off with the ladies and have a ball. Now we just need musicians.',

It’s very true. I jokingly told my true love we needed musicians for all of these dancers, and voilà, today we have pipers. Unfortunately, they are very bad pipers. On the bright side, though, the noise from all of the birds currently residing here kind of drowns them out.\r\n\r\nApparently, the birds aren’t fond of the pipers and have been doing everything in their power to disrupt the concert. We’ve got geese weaving between legs, calling birds dive bombing, and hens pecking at feet.\r\n\r\nThe pipers apparently have had enough and are taking a break. Thank heaven.\r\n\r\nOr not. Nick, John, and Steve have appropriated three of the pipes and are using them like lightsabers to see who can claim the title of Jedi Master. Nick just whacked John in the mouth, knocking out his two front teeth.\r\n\r\nIf you look up <em>Loss, teeth</em> in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index, you are directed to <em>see Absence, teeth, acquired</em>.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->We can choose between multiple causes of partial and complete tooth loss, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Trauma</li>\r\n	<li>Periodontal diseases</li>\r\n	<li>Caries</li>\r\n	<li>Other specified cause</li>\r\n	<li>Unspecified cause</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nGetting hit in the mouth with a pipe seems pretty traumatic to me, so we have our cause of acquired tooth loss. We also need to know whether it’s complete or partial tooth loss. While John lost two complete teeth, he still has all of the rest, so it’s partial tooth loss (meaning he’s lost some, but not all, of his teeth).\r\n\r\nOne final piece of information is the class, and you need the physician (or dentist) to document this information. You can’t guess. Classes range from I-IV and the clinician uses a number of factors to arrive at the correct class.\r\n\r\nSo if John suffered a class I partial loss of teeth due to trauma, we would report K08.411.\r\n\r\nCategory K04 features both type of Excludes notes:\r\n\r\nExcludes1:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Complete loss of teeth (K08.1-)</li>\r\n	<li>Congenital absence of teeth (K00.0)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nExcludes2:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Exfoliation of teeth due to systemic causes (K08.0)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIn ICD-10-CM, an Excludes1 note means the conditions are mutually exclusive. If you report one code, you can’t report the other. It makes sense that a patient can’t have a complete loss of teeth at the same time as partial loss of teeth.\r\n\r\nConditions listed in an Excludes2 note can occur at the same time as the code they are listed under and both conditions can be reported together.\r\n\r\nI guess we know what John will be asking Santa for this year.',

		'body' : 'On the 12th day of Christmas my true love gave to me 12 drummers drumming and the noise is unbelievable. I’ve got a migraine.\r\n\r\nI didn’t see any lights or odd visual disturbances beforehand, so this is a migraine without aura. And that makes the coding pretty simple. Migraines with aura have a lot more choices.<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/12-drummers.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-4258\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/12-drummers-300x236.jpg\" alt=\"12 drummers\" width=\"300\" height=\"236\" /></a>\r\n\r\nFor a migraine without aura, we need to know whether it is intractable or not intractable. Intractable means it doesn’t respond to treatment. We’re way too early in the process to know that, so for now, we’ll call it not intractable and see how the medication works.\r\n\r\nThe other piece of information we need to know is whether the patient is status migrainosus, meaning the migraine has lasted for at least 72 hours. I’m on hour two, so no status migrainosus. That gives us G43.009 (migraine without aura, not intractable, without status migrainosus).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, that’s not our only medical issue in the house today. Several of our drummers have developed carpal tunnel syndrome. This is another easily coded malady. We just need to know laterality to choose from:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>G56.00, carpal tunnel syndrome, unspecified upper limb</li>\r\n	<li>G56.01, carpal tunnel syndrome, right upper limb</li>\r\n	<li>G56.02, carpal tunnel syndrome, left upper limb</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nHow would we code the carpal tunnel surgery in ICD-10-PCS? Granted, most people have this procedure on an outpatient basis, but someone may opt to have this done during a hospital stay for another procedure.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->First we need to know the root operation. Let’s back up a step. What is the body system? Well, what is actually involved in a carpal tunnel procedure? The physician cuts the carpal ligament to free the median nerve.\r\n\r\nAre we performing a procedure on the ligament or the nerve? Actually, the purpose of the procedure is to free the nerve, which falls under root operation Release (freeing a body part from an abnormal physical constraint by cutting or by the use of force).\r\n\r\nThe physician isn’t freeing the ligament, he or she is freeing the nerve. That makes our body system (second character) the peripheral nervous system and the body part (fourth character) the median nerve.\r\n\r\nIf you look at table 01N (release of the peripheral nervous system), you’ll see a long list of nerves. What you don’t see is laterality. That comes in the ICD-10-CM code for this particular procedure.\r\n\r\nThe approach can be:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Open (0)</li>\r\n	<li>Percutaneous (3)</li>\r\n	<li>Percutaneous endoscopic (4)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe final two characters for this procedure will be ZZ because those are our only choices.\r\n\r\nFor a percutaneous carpal tunnel release procedure, we would report 01N53ZZ.\r\n\r\nAs the day winds down (and so do the drummers), Mr. Whiskers makes his final play for the partridge in the pear tree on the patio. He has perfected his stealth approach and is making his way to the base of the tree. Wait, he’s got something in his mouth. Eeew, it’s a dead mouse. And he’s leaving it at the base of the tree. How sweet. He wants to be friends. I guess there can be peace on Earth. Unless he’s trying to lure the partridge down so it’s easier prey. I wouldn’t put anything past that cat.',

We thought we were all set for October 1, 2014. CMS was standing firm. Healthcare organizations were preparing. And then Congress intervened.\r\n\r\nAt the end of March, the House and Senate passed the Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) patch bill that included at least a one-year delay in ICD-10 implementation. President Obama signed the bill into law April 1. Sadly, it wasn’t a joke.\r\n\r\nSo we’re left with more training costs, more time to worry, and no guarantee 2015 will be the year.\r\n\r\nThat doubt comes in part because the AMA has continued to beat its “kill ICD-10” drum. According to the AMA, ICD-10 is evil (literally—they claim ICD-10 would serve Darth Vader). The AMA also complained about the cost of implementing ICD-10 again (without noting how much each delay has added to those costs).\r\n\r\nAHIMA and 3M offered a rebuttal in the <em>Journal of AHIMA</em>. A group of 3M analysts published a study claiming the costs of ICD-10 implementation are nowhere near what Nachimson Advisors (who were paid by AMA, incidentally) claimed. Nachimson decried the 3M study as flawed, leaving everyone to believe whatever suited their purposes.\r\n\r\nThe mainstream media (and the AMA) continue to focus on the wrong things in the ICD-10 discussion—namely external cause codes. In the past, they harped on the bitten by duck codes. 2014 was the year of sucked into a jet engine, subsequent encounter. None of them seem to understand the concept of subsequent encounter. It’s not the second time you were sucked into a jet engine (or broke your left index finger). It’s follow-up treatment.\r\n\r\nMaybe if physicians took the time to understand ICD-10 they might not be so staunchly opposed. Then again, the AMA represents less than one-third of physicians, so I’m not sure what most physicians think. We just know what the AMA wants us to think they think.\r\n\r\nNow for the good news. Yes, we do have good news. One, the ICD-10 date is still standing at October 1, 2015, despite an AMA push over the last couple months for another two-year delay. Congress decided not to include another delay in the massive spending bill it passed earlier this month.\r\n\r\nWe’re unlikely to see any standalone bill kill ICD-10, even though Republicans in Congress are expected to reintroduce their Cutting Costly Codes bills which previously died in committee. However, we’re not out of the woods yet. Congress could still decide to add a delay into the SGR patch (or permanent fix) next year.\r\n\r\nBut the pro-ICD-10 crowd seems to have found our voice. AHIMA has been at the forefront of social media and grassroots campaigns to support ICD-10. I don’t know if they are making a difference, but at least we’re getting our side of the story out. AMA\'s narrative that ICD-10 won\'t improve patient care and will bankrupt physicians has stronger competition than ever.\r\n\r\nEven with the latest delay, many organizations continued to train on ICD-10 and dual code, just at a slower pace. That’s better than the near complete stop we had when the previous delay was announced in 2012.\r\n\r\nWe have a lot of work to do in 2015 (and beyond—implementation problems won’t end when we flip the switch). But we should look forward with optimism and do our best to spread the word about the value of ICD-10.',

You don’t necessarily need to spend an extended period of time outdoors to develop frostbite. It can happen in 30 minutes when the wind chill is below 0°F.\r\n\r\nIn ICD-9-CM, we have four total codes for frostbite, depending on the location (face, hand, foot, and other and unspecified sites).\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM divides frostbite into two categories: superficial frostbite and frostbite with tissue necrosis. Each category is further divided by specific site (and we have a lot more than four sites).\r\n\r\nIf we have a patient with superficial frostbite of the hand, we would need to know which hand, whether any fingers were involved, and whether the wrist is involved. We also need a seventh character to denote the encounter.\r\n\r\nYou’ll find one Excludes2 note under Frostbite (code categories T33-T34):\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Excludes2:</strong> hypothermia and other effects of reduced temperature (T68, T69.-)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<!--more-->The note tells you that hypothermia and other effects of reduced temperature are not included under frostbite, but the patient can have both conditions at the same time. If the physician documents both, you can code both.\r\n\r\nYou can also have a patient with both superficial frostbite and frostbite with tissue necrosis. For example, a patient may come in for an initial encounter for frostbite with tissue necrosis of the left toes (T34.832A) and superficial frostbite of the left foot (T33.822A).\r\n\r\nWe’ve also seen some cases of hypothermia here at the clinic. Patients can develop hypothermia if they stay outside too long in the cold or if they are suddenly get wet in the cold. For example, people skating on a lake may fall through the ice.\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM offers one code for hypothermia: T68. This code does require a seventh character to denote the encounter, so you’ll also need three X placeholders to move that seventh character to the seventh position in the code.\r\n\r\nT68 also includes a note to use an additional code to identify source of exposure:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Exposure to excessive cold of man-made origin (W93)</li>\r\n	<li>Exposure to excessive cold of natural origin (X31)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou’ll also notice both types of Excludes notes under T68.-.\r\n\r\nExcludes1 notes designate codes that are mutually exclusive.

A patient can suffer from both frostbite and hypothermia at the same time and you would code both conditions.\r\n\r\nAll of this talk about frostbite and hypothermia is making me really cold.

Sunlight reflects off the snow and ice and, as everyone who lives in snowy areas knows, it always finds the unprotected areas.\r\n\r\nSunburn is pretty easy to code in ICD-10-CM. All we need to know is what degree the sunburn is. That’s it. No location, no laterality, no episode of care.\r\n\r\nDr. Frosty documents a first-degree sunburn, so we would report L55.0 (sunburn of first degree).\r\n\r\nOn to those chilblains. Don’t know the difference between chilblains and frostbite? The big difference is whether the tissue freezes. If it does, the patient likely ends up with frostbite. Frostbite can be superficial or with tissue necrosis.\r\n\r\nChilblains are the painful inflammation of small blood vessels in your skin that occur when you suddenly warm up after being in cold temperatures.\r\n\r\nChilblains usually clear up in one to three weeks, but may reoccur.\r\n\r\nThis is another easy condition to code in ICD-10-CM.

I’m having one of those. One of the downsides to have a window cube is the cold seeps in with the sunshine. Or with the dreary gray day.\r\n\r\nWhy am I so cold? Maybe I am hypothermic. Hypothermia is a medical emergency that occurs when your body loses heat faster than it can produce it, causing a dangerously low body temperature. Okay, maybe not. Out of curiosity, how would we code hypothermia in ICD-10-CM?\r\n\r\nWell, we need to know the age of the patient. ICD-10-CM includes a series of codes for hypothermia in a newborn (P80.-). For adult patients, we need to know the cause of the hypothermia:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Hypothermia due to illness (R68.0)</li>\r\n	<li>Hypothermia, not associated with low environmental temperature (R68.0)</li>\r\n	<li>Hypothermia NOS (accidental) (T68)</li>\r\n	<li>Hypothermia due to anesthesia (T88.51)</li>\r\n	<li>Hypothermia due to low environmental temperature (T68)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIf I were in fact hypothermic, it would be because it’s cold out, so T68.XXXA for an initial encounter. Notice you need three placeholder Xs for this code so your seventh character for the encounter is in the seventh position.\r\n\r\nUnder T68, we also find a note to use an additional code to identify the source of exposure:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Exposure to excessive cold of man-made origin (W93)</li>\r\n	<li>Exposure to excessive cold of natural origin (X31)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<!--more-->T68 also has both an Excludes1 and Excludes2 note.\r\n\r\nExcludes1 means the conditions are mutually exclusive, so you can’t have T68 with:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Hypothermia following anesthesia (T88.51)</li>\r\n	<li>Hypothermia not associated with low environmental temperature (R68.0)</li>\r\n	<li>Hypothermia of newborn (P80.-)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThat makes sense, right? A patient’s hypothermia can’t be due to low environmental temperature and not due to low environmental temperature at the same time. Also if the hypothermia is due to anesthesia, it can’t also be due to low environmental temperature.\r\n\r\nExcludes2 means the patient can have both conditions and when both are present, coders report both. In this case a patient can suffer from hypothermia and frostbite (T33-T34) at the same time. Again, that make sense.\r\n\r\nNone of this solves my chills, however. If my only symptom is chills and the physician can’t determine an actual medical diagnosis, we can code the symptom of chills. We have several code choices:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Chills with fever (R50.9)</li>\r\n	<li>Chills (without fever) (R68.83)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAgain those conditions both have Excludes1 notes, telling you they are mutually exclusive.\r\n\r\nFeeling cold all the time is one symptom of hypothyroidism (along with dry skin, thinning hair, and weight gain). To code hypothyroidism, we need to know the cause.\r\n\r\nIs it congenital? We have two codes: one for with goiter (E03.0) and one for without goiter (E03.1).\r\n\r\nOther choices include:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Iatrogenic NEC (E03.2)</li>\r\n	<li>Iodine-deficiency (acquired) (E01.8)</li>\r\n	<li>Subclinical (E02)</li>\r\n	<li>Postinfectious (E03.3)</li>\r\n	<li>Postirradiation (E89.0)</li>\r\n	<li>Postprocedural (E89.0)</li>\r\n	<li>Postsurgical (E89.0)</li>\r\n	<li>Specified NEC (E03.8)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIt can also be due to:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Exogenous substance NEC (E03.2)</li>\r\n	<li>Iodine-deficiency, acquired (E01.8)</li>\r\n	<li>Subclinical (E02)</li>\r\n	<li>Irradiation therapy (E89.0)</li>\r\n	<li>Medicament NEC (E03.2)</li>\r\n	<li>P-aminosalicylic acid (PAS) (E03.2)</li>\r\n	<li>Phenylbutazone (E03.2)</li>\r\n	<li>Resorcinol (E03.2)</li>\r\n	<li>Sulfonamide (E03.2)</li>\r\n	<li>Surgery (E89.0)</li>\r\n	<li>Thiourea group drugs (E03.2)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nEven though ICD-10-CM includes a lot of terms, most of them fall under just a few codes. If your physicians are not in the habit of specifying the cause of a patient’s hypothyroidism, start asking for it now. At the very least, show them the new codes and ask nicely if they can include that information going forward.\r\n\r\nAs interesting as this is, all of this coding is not making me warmer. Maybe it’s time for a coffee. Although I am a little jittery from the eight cups of coffee I’ve already had today. I’m also kind of dizzy and a little nauseous.\r\n\r\nOh, no, caffeine poisoning!\r\n\r\nOff to the Table of Drugs and Chemicals. This will look very familiar. We have one in ICD-9-CM.\r\n\r\nIn the table, we’ll look up “caffeine” and see we have six possible codes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Poisoning accidental</li>\r\n	<li>Poisoning, intentional self-harm</li>\r\n	<li>Poisoning, assault</li>\r\n	<li>Poisoning, undetermined</li>\r\n	<li>After effect</li>\r\n	<li>Underdosing</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nI’m not sure how you can underdose with caffeine, but maybe it happens.\r\n\r\nIn my case, it’s an accidental poisoning, so we would report T43.611.\r\n\r\nI give up. I’m going in search of a space heater.',

Just think back to how quickly avian flu spread starting in 2003.\r\n\r\nIt turns out that diseases have been crossing that species barrier for quite some time. <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/seals-brought-tb-to-americas-1.15748\">Researchers just announced</a> that seals first brought tuberculosis (TB) to North America. That’s right, seals.\r\n\r\nEuropeans brought a second strain of TB to the New World when the Spanish colonized South America in the 16<sup>th</sup> century.\r\n\r\nTB certainly isn’t a new disease. It’s been around for somewhere in the neighborhood of 70,000 years.\r\n\r\nBoth ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM include multiple categories of TB codes depending on where the infection is present. In ICD-9-CM, coders need to choose the appropriate fifth character from:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>0, unspecified</li>\r\n	<li>1, bacteriological or histological examination not done</li>\r\n	<li>2, bacteriological or histological examination unknown (at present)</li>\r\n	<li>3, tubercle bacilli found (in sputum) by microscopy</li>\r\n	<li>4, tubercle bacilli not found (in sputum) by microscopy, but found by bacterial culture</li>\r\n	<li>5, tubercle bacilli not found by bacteriological examination, but tuberculosis confirmed histologically</li>\r\n	<li>6, tubercle bacilli not found by bacteriological or histological examination, but tuberculosis confirmed by other methods (inoculation of animals)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nIn ICD-10-CM, we don’t need that information.\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM breaks TB down into these categories:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>A15, respiratory tuberculosis</li>\r\n	<li>A17, tuberculosis of the nervous system</li>\r\n	<li>A18, tuberculosis of other organs</li>\r\n	<li>A19, miliary tuberculosis</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThat’s fewer categories than the nine in ICD-9-CM, in part because ICD-10-CM rolls TB of the bones and joints in with TB of other organs.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the TB section, ICD-10-CM tells us that infections due to <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> and <em>Mycobacterium bovis</em> are included in the TB codes.\r\n\r\nWe also see an Excludes1 note for these conditions:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Congenital tuberculosis (P37.0)</li>\r\n	<li>Nonspecific reaction to test for tuberculosis without active tuberculosis (R76.1-)</li>\r\n	<li>Pneumoconiosis associated with tuberculosis, any type in A15 (J65)</li>\r\n	<li>Positive PPD (R76.11)</li>\r\n	<li>Positive tuberculin skin test without active tuberculosis (R76.11)</li>\r\n	<li>Sequelae of tuberculosis (B90.-)</li>\r\n	<li>Silicotuberculosis (J65)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAn Excludes1 note means the conditions are mutually exclusive. If the patient has one, he or she can’t have the other. Make sure you always check the beginning of the code category for notes. If you were coding for military TB, you wouldn’t see the Excludes1 note because it’s three pages away.\r\n\r\nIf a physician suspects a patient has TB, but doesn’t have the TB test results, what do you code? That depends on the setting.\r\n\r\nIf the physician documents “suspect,” “rule out,” or “probable” TB at the time an inpatient is discharged, you can report the TB as though it is confirmed.\r\n\r\nOn the outpatient side, you can’t. You can only code the symptoms if the physician documents \"possible,\" \"probable,\" or \"rule out\" TB.\r\n\r\n<em>Mycobacterium pinnipedii </em>(the strain of TB that affect seals and sea lions, aka pinnipeds) has been transmitted from seals to humans in zoos.

So which root operation do we use when a physician performs a biopsy?\r\n\r\nThe answer is, it depends.\r\n\r\nWe will select a root operation in ICD-10-PCS based on the intent of the procedure.\r\n\r\nFor example, Dr. Sharpe documents a thoracentesis, which is a procedure to remove fluid from the space between the lining of the outside of the lungs and the chest wall. For that procedure, we use root operation Drainage (taking or letting out of fluids and/or gases from a body part).\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to coding a biopsy in ICD-10-PCS, we need to look at what the physician is actually removing.\r\n\r\nLet’s say Betsy came in with a growth on her thyroid. Dr. Sharpe decides to perform a needle biopsy to see whether the growth is cancerous. For this type of biopsy, Dr. Sharpe is removing a small piece of Betsy’s thyroid for examination.\r\n\r\nWe would use root operation Excision because Dr. Sharpe’s intent is to cutting out, without replacement, a portion of a body part. We would use the same root operation for liver biopsies, breast biopsies, and so on.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->To tell the payer Dr. Sharpe is removing the tissue for a biopsy, we would use the seventh character X (diagnostic). Make sure the ICD-10-PCS table you’re using includes X as an option for the seventh character.\r\n\r\nNot all biopsies fall under Excision. Go back to the thoracentesis procedure we started with. Dr. Sharpe may be removing that fluid to perform a biopsy. We would still use root operation Drainage, we just need to use the diagnostic qualifier.\r\n\r\nThen we have bone marrow biopsies. Bone marrow is spongy tissue inside some of your larger bones. Bone marrow functions as part of the lymphatic and hemic system. When Dr. Sharpe performs a bone marrow biopsy, he uses a specially designed needle to collect a core (cylindrical sample) of bone marrow.\r\n\r\nWe will code bone marrow biopsies using the root operation Extraction (pulling or stripping out or off all or a portion of a body part by the use of force). Again, we will use the seventh character X to denote this is a biopsy.\r\n\r\nThe ICD-10-PCS Alphabetic Index will be a big help when it comes to coding biopsies. If you look up biopsy in the index, it directs you to:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>See Drainage with qualifier Diagnostic</li>\r\n	<li>See Excision with qualifier Diagnostic</li>\r\n	<li>Bone Marrow, see Extraction with qualifier Diagnostic</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<em>Coding Clinic</em>, Fourth Quarter 2013, p. 111, also addresses the root operation for a bone marrow biopsy.',

He was out shoveling the snow using the tried-and-true lift, jerk, and fling method. During one of his tosses, he felt a sharp pain in his shoulder and started having trouble lifting his arm. Dr. Frosty examines Doug and diagnoses a torn rotator cuff.\r\n\r\nDo we have enough information to code Doug’s injury in ICD-10-CM? If we look up tear, rotator cuff, in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index, we find out very quickly that we need more information. Was this a traumatic tear?\r\n\r\nIt’s tempting to say yes right off the bat because Dr. Frosty documented that the injury occurred while Doug was shoveling snow. You can tear you rotator cuff by lifting something too heavy with a jerking motion. However, the majority of rotator cuff tears result from a wearing down of the tendon over time. In his chart, Doug’s age is listed as 57, so we could be looking at a nontraumatic tear.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->Let’s take a look at the rest of Dr. Frosty’s documentation to see if we can find any indication of whether Doug’s injury is traumatic. As we read further down the note, we see this information:\r\n\r\n<em>MRI shows partial tear of right rotator cuff. Doug is a house painter and frequently shovels out neighbor’s driveway in winter. Repetitive motion likely contributed to tear. </em>\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM includes codes for traumatic (S46.01-) and nontraumatic (M75.1-) rotator cuff tears. Dr. Frosty did not specifically indicate which kind Doug suffered, but his documentation seems to lean toward nontraumatic. After all, he is referencing repetitive motion.\r\n\r\nWe know as coders that we can’t assume and in the case of rotator cuff injuries, ICD-10-CM helps us out a little. The description for codes in the M75.1- subcategory include the words “rotator cuff tear or rupture not specified as traumatic.”\r\n\r\nDr. Frosty didn’t specify a traumatic rupture, so we’re going to use the M75.1- codes. The codes are further subdivided by the degree of the tear:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Unspecified</li>\r\n	<li>Incomplete</li>\r\n	<li>Complete</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe know Doug suffered an incomplete tear, so we’ll go with M75.111 for a right rotator cuff repair. We don’t need a seventh character to specify the encounter because we are using a code from Chapter 13 (diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue).\r\n\r\nIf Dr. Frosty documented a traumatic rupture, we would have used a S46.01- code from Chapter 19 (injury, poisoning and certain other consequences of external causes), and we would have needed a seventh character to indicate the encounter.\r\n\r\nDr. Frosty also sees Jocelyn, who comes in complaining of pain on the outside of her left elbow. She is having trouble bending the elbow and she experiences pain when she tries to bend it. She is also unable to turn her forearm to rotate her palm.\r\n\r\nJocelyn was making a last-minute grocery run yesterday to prepare for today’s storm. She slipped and used her left arm to break her fall. She said her arm hurt a little yesterday, but not enough to seek treatment. However, her arm really bothered her today, so she came into the clinic.\r\n\r\nDr. Frosty orders an x-ray that reveals a fracture of the left radial head.\r\n\r\nIf you look up fracture, radial head, in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index, you see a note to see Fracture, radius, upper end, head. Really? They couldn’t just give me the code?\r\n\r\nWell, no, and for good reason it turns out. Once we get to Fracture, radius, upper end, head, we find multiple options:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Head</li>\r\n	<li>Neck</li>\r\n	<li>Specified NEC</li>\r\n	<li>Physeal</li>\r\n	<li>Torus</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe know we’re dealing with the head of the radius, which leads us to S52.12-.\r\n\r\nThe next thing we need to know is whether the fracture is displaced. Dr. Frosty doesn’t specify, but we do have a default in ICD-10-CM.\r\n\r\nA note above every section of fracture codes instructs us to code a fracture not indicated as displaced or nondisplaced as displaced.\r\n\r\nIs the fracture open or closed? Again Dr. Frosty didn’t specify, but he also did not note any open wounds. Query or guess? We know not to guess, but we don’t have to query either. ICD-10-CM includes another helpful default. This one tells us to code a fracture not indicated as open or closed as closed.\r\n\r\nNow we have an initial encounter for a closed, displaced fracture of the left radial head, which gives us code S52.122A.\r\n\r\nI certainly hope the maintenance staff clears the parking lot of snow and ice before it’s time for us to go home!',

He told Dr. Frosty that he spent six hours shoveling snow yesterday and today can barely stand the pain.\r\n\r\nDr. Frosty sends Richard for an MRI, which reveals a herniated disc. What information do we need to code Richard’s condition?\r\n\r\nIf you look up herniated disc in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index, you won’t find it. You will find an entry for nucleus pulposus (the fancy medical name for an intervertebral disc). That entry directs you to see Displacement, intervertebral disc.\r\n\r\nWhen we get there, we find that we need some additional information, specifically where in <!--more-->the back the herniated disc is located. ICD-10-CM separates the back into:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Cervical</li>\r\n	<li>Lumbar</li>\r\n	<li>Lumbrosacral</li>\r\n	<li>Sacrococcygeal</li>\r\n	<li>Thoracic</li>\r\n	<li>Thoracolumbar</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIf you aren’t familiar with the anatomy of the spine, now is a good time to brush up. Fortunately, though, ICD-10-CM combines thoracic, thoracolumbar, and lumbosacral intervertebral discs into one series of codes. However, each region is separated in the subseries so Dr. Frosty needs to be very specific about which disc is herniated.\r\n\r\nDr. Frosty documents the herniation is in the lumbar region, so we’re in the M51. - subsection of codes. What else do we need to know?\r\n\r\nDoes Richard have myelopathy (spinal cord compression), radiculopathy (radiating pain), or disc displacement? Richard mentioned pain in his back, buttocks, leg, and calf, so Dr. Frosty documents radiculopathy.\r\n\r\nThat gives us M51.16 (intervertebral disc disorders with radiculopathy, lumbar region). If Richard suffered from multiple herniated discs at different levels, say the lumbar and the lumbrosacral, you would need to report two codes (or one for each region if Richard had a really bad back).\r\n\r\nIn fact, category M51 features two Excludes2 notes. An Excludes2 note tells you the listed codes are not part of the code you are looking at, but the patient can suffer from both conditions. If so, you report both codes. The Excludes2 note under M51 lets you know you can report M51- codes with codes from these two series:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Cervical and cervicothoracic disc disorders (M50.-)</li>\r\n	<li>Sacral and sacrococcygeal disorders (M53.3)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nICD-10-CM does not (yet) break the codes down to the individual disc so all you need is the region(s).\r\n\r\nBernie suffered a slightly different shoveling injury. He claims he was attacked by his snow shovel. Um, Bernie, what were you hydrating with before you went out and shoveled?\r\n\r\nIt turns out, Bernie’s shovel did attack him after a fashion. Bernie was shoveling the sidewalk when his kids came out to play. He decided to stick the shovel in a snow bank and help the kids build the world’s most awesome snow fort. During construction, Bernie lost track of the shovel and it got buried in the fort. Oops.\r\n\r\nAfter completing construction, Bernie was disembarking from the fort and stepped on the shovel handle. If you’ve ever seen a cartoon character step on a rake, you know what happened to Bernie. The shovel blade came up and smacked him in the face. The kids thought it was pretty funny, especially when Bernie fell down (and went “boom!” according to his son).\r\n\r\nFortunately, Bernie’s shovel does not have a metal blade on the end (that would have been really bad). He ended up with a big bruise on his forehead and the aforementioned blurry vision. Bernie’s wife decided to bring him in to the Fix ‘Em Up Clinic as a precaution.\r\n\r\nGood thing, too, as Dr. Frosty diagnosed a mild concussion. Bernie says he doesn’t think he lost consciousness, but he’s not sure. In ICD-10-CM, concussion codes are broken down by the length of time the patient lost consciousness.\r\n\r\nDr. Frosty’s final diagnosis is a mild concussion with no loss of consciousness and a forehead contusion. That gives us codes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S06.0X0A, concussion without loss of consciousness, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S00.83XA, contusion of other part of head, initial encounter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe forehead doesn’t rate its own code apparently, so it is lumped in with other parts of the head. This is a not elsewhere classified code, meaning we have the information, we just don’t have a specific enough code. It’s not the same as a not otherwise specified code, which means the physician didn’t document the information. Maybe the forehead will get its due when we get the first round of ICD-10-CM updates.\r\n\r\nUntil then, be safe while shoveling and remember where you put your snow removal equipment.',

It’s also the day after the Super Bowl, which means patients with a variety of injuries arrived at the Fix ‘Em Up Clinic today.\r\n\r\nFirst is Phil, who is convinced he is a groundhog. He’s not. He’s really just a guy in a groundhog suit, but he’s sure he is indeed THE Punxsutawney Phil, seer of seers, sage of sages, prognosticator of prognosticators, and weather prophet extraordinaire. Okay, then. Dr. Jung will see you now.\r\n\r\nIt turns out that Phil (the person) had a few too many adult beverages while waiting for Phil (the actual groundhog) to make his prediction. It’s six more weeks of winter, in case you missed it. (Stupid rodent.)\r\n\r\nDr. Jung diagnoses Phil (the person) with alcohol poisoning. Off to the Table of Drugs and Chemicals we go. Coding for poisonings in ICD-10-CM is very similar to coding for them in <!--more-->ICD-9-CM. The Table of Drugs and Chemicals lists the various substances with six columns that indicate how the poisoning happened:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Poisoning, accidental (unintentional)</li>\r\n	<li>Poisoning, intentional self-harm</li>\r\n	<li>Poisoning, assault</li>\r\n	<li>Poisoning, undetermined</li>\r\n	<li>Adverse effect</li>\r\n	<li>Underdosing</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThose choices are slightly different from the ones we currently have and underdosing is a new option for ICD-10-CM.\r\n\r\nIn Phil’s case, Dr. Jung diagnosed an accidental alcohol poisoning and also documented alcohol abuse. So we’ll need to code for that as well.\r\n\r\nWhen you look up alcohol in the Table of Drugs and Chemicals, you’ll notice ICD-10-CM includes quite a few types of alcohol. Four of them include a subentry for beverage. The alcohol usually used in beverages is ethyl alcohol, so for Phil, we would report T51.0X1A (toxic effect of ethanol, accidental [unintentional], initial encounter).\r\n\r\nFor Phil’s alcohol abuse, we need a little more information. ICD-10-CM includes codes for\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Uncomplicated</li>\r\n	<li>With intoxication</li>\r\n	<li>With alcohol-induced mood disorder</li>\r\n	<li>With alcohol-induced psychotic disorder</li>\r\n	<li>With other alcohol-induced disorders</li>\r\n	<li>With unspecified alcohol-induced disorder</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWell, Phil does think he’s a groundhog, but is that simply a sign of intoxication or is it an indicator of psychosis? Fortunately, Dr. Jung documented that Phil is suffering from intoxication delirium and is not delusional, so we would report F10.121 (alcohol abuse with intoxication delirium).\r\n\r\nPhil is off to sober up and hopefully stop imagining he is a rodent, which brings us to Larry.\r\n\r\nLarry was a little displeased with Phil’s prognostication, so he planned to “fix that little so-and-so but good.” Larry’s plan was to shoot Phil with a shotgun, so he loaded his weapon, packed up his car, and headed off to Punxsutawney.\r\n\r\nLuckily for Phil, Larry forgot to pack his GPS, and since Punxsutawney isn’t a large town, Larry ended up missing it and wandering the wilds of Jefferson County. Larry stopped by the side of the snowy road to relieve himself (he drank a lot of coffee on his roadtrip) and took his shotgun with him. He didn’t want someone to steal it while he was away from the vehicle.\r\n\r\nShould have left the gun in the car, Larry. On his way back to the vehicle, Larry slipped and accidentally discharged his shotgun. The shell went off into the woods, where it went a little too close to a deer. Said deer decided to charge Larry, who miraculously managed to avoid the angry animal. Of course he did that by slipping again, this time landing on his back. He stayed still long enough for the deer to lose interest and head back into the woods.\r\n\r\nLarry’s immobility, however, was not due to a desire to avoid the deer. When he fell, his head hit a rock, which knocked him out. Fortunately, some locals found him and brought him in.\r\n\r\nDr. Thumper examines Larry, who regain consciousness shortly after arriving at the clinic and diagnoses a concussion with loss of consciousness (LOC). Based on Larry’s best recollection and information from the rescuers, Dr. Thumper estimates that Larry was unconscious for two to three hours. Dr. Thumper also documents a three-inch laceration to the back of the skull with no foreign body and mild frostbite of ears, fingers, and toes. The frostbite affects both ears, the fingers of the right hand, and the toes of both feet.\r\n\r\nBased on Dr. Thumper’s documentation, we would report:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S06.0X3A, concussion with loss of consciousness of 1 hour to 5 hours 59 minutes, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S01.01XA, laceration without foreign body of scalp, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>T33.011A, superficial frostbite of right ear, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>T33.012A, superficial frostbite of left ear, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>T33.531A, superficial frostbite of right finger(s), initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>T33.831A, superficial frostbite of right toe(s), initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>T33.832A, superficial frostbite of left toe(s), initial encounter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAll of these codes require a seventh character to indicate the encounter, but the laceration code also requires a placeholder X. The X in the concussion code is actually part of the code. You don’t need to add it. ICD-10-CM already did.\r\n\r\nThe other thing to note is the fingers and toes are only divided by laterality, not by specific digits. You’ll use the same code regardless of the number of fingers or toes affected, as long as they are on the same limb.\r\n\r\nLarry wisely decided to drop his vendetta against Phil (especially since our patient Phil is still wandering around in his groundhog getup).\r\n\r\nNow we come to our final patient of the day, Bill. Bill was so excited by the Super Bowl halftime show that he started jumping up and down on the couch. And then he missed the couch and landed awkwardly on the floor. His right ankle “crumpled and really hurt,” according to Bill. He also reported that his rear end is very painful.\r\n\r\nHowever, Bill didn’t want to miss the end of the game so he waited until today to seek treatment. His ankle is extremely swollen and Bill is unable to put any weight on it.\r\n\r\nDr. Setter sends Bill for some diagnostic imaging, which reveals a dislocated ankle with a displaced bimalleolar fracture and a fractured coccyx. Based on Dr. Setter’s documentation, we would code:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S82.841A, displaced bimalleolar fracture of right lower leg, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S93.04XA, dislocation of right ankle joint, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S32.2XXA, fracture of coccyx, initial encounter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAgain, all of these codes require a seventh character, and two of them require placeholder Xs to make sure the seventh character is in the seventh position.\r\n\r\nMost fractures in ICD-10-CM include codes for displaced or non-displaced. Fracture of the coccyx is one of the exceptions. You only have one base code. Of course you can choose from six seventh character options, so you can actually report six different codes. You do need to go to the start of category S32 (fracture of lumbar spine and pelvis) to find the list of appropriate seventh characters.\r\n\r\nFortunately, our waiting room is cleared and we can call it a day. Just remember, don’t drive angry.',

PAMA served as another patch to the Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) payment reductions for physicians.\r\n\r\nThe subcommittee has been working on another permanent SGR fix, which would eliminate the yearly drama of “will they or won’t they put off the payment cuts again.” The subcommittee had a permanent fix last year, but it didn’t make it to law.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->I am a little concerned about <a href=\"http://energycommerce.house.gov/subcommittees/health#members\">the makeup of the subcommittee</a> that could once again derail ICD-10 implementation. The House Energy and Commerce Committee members include physicians who are interested in ICD-10 implementation for good or ill. In the past, the broader “doc block” in Congress has been very anti-ICD-10. They have used the flaming water skis and sucked into a jet engine, subsequent encounter, as examples of why ICD-10 is unnecessary, which doesn’t inspire confidence.\r\n\r\nOn the positive side, the Coalition for ICD-10 will hold <a href=\"http://coalitionforicd10.org/2015/02/02/coalition-to-brief-congress-on-icd-10-transition/\">a Congressional briefing</a> the day before the subcommittee’s hearing.

How many people can do any new task requiring specific skills successfully without practicing?\r\n\r\nWe can’t consider the transition to ICD-10-CM/PCS occurring on October 1, 2015 (or we pray anyway) a minor transition for all who code or use codes. I know we probably all feel a little gun-shy after the delay that was announced April 1, 2014. But please don’t just sit idle and not use all that you have learned about ICD-10-CM/PCS because you are worried it will be delayed again. To help keep your ICD-10 muscles in shape, HCPro created a class that is just for those who already learned ICD-10-CM/PCS, but want to practice.\r\n\r\nCodercise-Inpatient ICD-10-CM/PCS is a two-day class intended for those who already have completed ICD-10-CM/PCS training. We’re teaching at an intermediate-advanced level because we didn’t want you to duplicate efforts by learning the fundamentals again. You’ve already put in that work. We’re going to help you refine and reinforce your knowledge.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->The class begins with a short non-graded quiz hitting the highlights of major guidelines/conventions in ICD-10-CM/PCS just in case we need to review anything. The remainder of class time is spent coding real inpatient records by assigning diagnosis (ICD-10-CM) and procedure (ICD-10-PCS) codes then reviewing with the class.\r\n\r\nICD-10-PCS is the most different and difficult to learn for most inpatient coders. For the many surgical procedures in our case studies, we have visual aids that will help you comprehend how to select the characters for an ICD-10-PCS code. Half the battle is understanding how to differentiate between the options on the ICD-10-PCS tables and knowing how selection of characters can impact reimbursement.\r\n\r\nEach of our instructors have been teaching inpatient coding for more than a decade. So unlike some of our competitors, we not only know ICD-10-CM/PCS, but we can also relate to how it differs from inpatient coding in ICD-9-CM! We go well beyond the same ICD-10-PCS examples we’ve probably all seen in a webinar, book, or other learning material.\r\n\r\nNot sure you’re ready for Codercise-Inpatient ICD-10-CM/PCS? No worries! We also offer the comprehensive Certified Coder Boot Camp-ICD-10-CM/PCS version <a href=\"http://hcmarketplace.com/certified-coder-boot-camp-online-icd-10-and-icd-10-pcs-online-1\">online</a> and <a href=\"http://hcmarketplace.com/certified-coder-boot-camp-icd-10-cm-and-icd-10-pcs-1\">live</a>.\r\n\r\nJoin me March 23-24<sup>, </sup>2015 in Las Vegas for Codercise-Inpatient ICD-10-CM/PCS!\r\nI love seeing familiar faces and also meeting new ones!',

The meanings of characters two through six, however, vary by section.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->The second character in many other ICD-10-PCS codes represents the body system. In other sections, it represents:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Anatomical region (Placement, Osteopathic, Chiropractic)</li>\r\n	<li>Physiological System and Anatomical Region (Administration)</li>\r\n	<li>Physiological System (Measurement and Monitoring, Extracorporeal Assistance and Performance, Extracorporeal Therapies)</li>\r\n	<li>Section Qualifier (Physical Rehabilitation and Diagnostic Audiology)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nFor almost all sections, the third character represents the root operation. In the Radiation, Physical Rehabilitation and Diagnostic Audiology, Mental Health, and Substance Abuse Treatment, the third character represents the root type.\r\n\r\nSome root operations appear in multiple sections of the manual. For example, the root operation Change (taking out or off a device from a body part and putting back an identical or similar device in or on the same body part without cutting or puncturing the skin or a mucous membrane) is used in both the Medical and Surgical and Placement sections.\r\n\r\nHowever, the third character in an ICD-10-PCS code can represent different root operations depending on the section. In Medical and Surgical, the root operation character value 2 represents Change. In the Imaging section, 2 represents CT scan.\r\n\r\nThe meaning of the fourth character also varies among sections. In some sections, it means the body part, just as it does in the Medical and Surgical section. In other sections, it represents:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Body Region/Orifice (Placement)</li>\r\n	<li>Body System/Region (Administration)</li>\r\n	<li>Body System (Measurement and Monitoring, Extracorporeal Assistance and Performance, Extracorporeal Therapies)</li>\r\n	<li>Body Region (Osteopathic, Other Procedures, Chiropractic)</li>\r\n	<li>Treatment site (Radiation Therapy)</li>\r\n	<li>Body System and Region (Physical Rehabilitation and Diagnostic Audiology)</li>\r\n	<li>Type Qualifier (Mental Health, Substance Abuse Treatment)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe fifth character can represent the approach, just as it does in the Medical and Surgical section, or it can denote:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Duration (Extracorporeal Assistance and Performance, Extracorporeal Therapies)</li>\r\n	<li>Contract (Imaging)</li>\r\n	<li>Radionucleotide (Nuclear Medicine)</li>\r\n	<li>Modality Qualifier (Radiation Therapy)</li>\r\n	<li>Type Qualifier (Physical Rehabilitation and Diagnostic Audiology, Mental Health, Substance Abuse Treatment)</li>\r\n	<li>Qualifier (Mental Health, Substance Abuse Treatment)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIn the Medical and Surgical section, the sixth character represents a device, as it does for Placement. In other sections, the sixth character is:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Substance (Administration)</li>\r\n	<li>Function/Device (Measurement and Monitoring)</li>\r\n	<li>Function (Extracorporeal Assistance and Performance, Extracorporeal Therapies)</li>\r\n	<li>Method (Osteopathic, Other Procedures, Chiropractic)</li>\r\n	<li>Qualifier (Imaging, Nuclear Medicine, Mental Health, Substance Abuse Treatment)</li>\r\n	<li>Isotope (Radiation Therapy)</li>\r\n	<li>Equipment (Physical Rehabilitation and Diagnostic Audiology)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWhen you use these other sections, make sure you know what each character defines.

Members of the committee then asked witnesses a wide range of questions about ICD-10.\r\n\r\nSix of the witnesses were pro-ICD-10. The lone voice against ICD-10 came from William Jefferson Terry, MD, a practicing urologist from Alabama who represented the American Urological Association.\r\n\r\nThe committee members weren’t as pro-ICD-10 as the witnesses. Interestingly enough, though, most of them admitted we need to move to ICD-10. They just didn’t say when. Rep. Kathy Castor (D-Florida) did urge no more delays and Rep. Chris Collins (R- New York) said we should get ICD-10 sooner rather than later.\r\n\r\n<strong>Costs</strong>\r\n\r\nNot surprisingly, the cost of the transition came up repeatedly and the projected costs varied widely. Edward M. Burke, MD, from the Beyer Medical Group in Missouri, told the subcommittee that his small practice (two physicians and three nurse practitioners) was already using ICD-10 and they had no problems making the switch. He also said they incurred no additional costs. Their software vendor handled all of the transition work.\r\n\r\n“We did not have special training,” Burke said. “We did not spend ANY money in preparation. We did not see less patie<!--more-->nts and our practice did not suffer. As providers, it was not frustrating or scary. It just was.”\r\n\r\nOn the other end of the spectrum was Terry, who said he would have to spend $5,000 if he wanted to attend ICD-10 training. (I’m not sure where he came up with that number. I’ve seen training, including HCPro’s Boot Camps, for a lot less money.)\r\n\r\nRich Averill, director of public policy for 3M Health Information Systems, brought up the just-published Professional Association of Health Care Office Management (PAHCOM) survey that put the costs of implementing ICD-10 for a small practice at approximately $8,000. He also mentioned that two other recent studies put the costs even lower. He didn’t name them, but I’m guessing that one is <a href=\"http://journal.ahima.org/wp-content/uploads/Week-3_PDFpost.FINAL-Estimating-the-Cost-of-Conversion-to-ICD-10_-Nov-12.pdf\">the 3M study published in the <em>Journal of AHIMA</em></a>.\r\n\r\nTerry countered later in the hearing that the PAHCOM study probably wasn’t reliable since it was done by PAHCOM surveying its members. He cited the <a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/2014/11/what-will-the-icd-10-transition-really-cost/\">Nachimson study</a> that estimated small physician practices will spend $56,639-$226,105 on ICD-10 implementation. He called that study “independent” even though AMA paid for it. No one called him on that.\r\n\r\n<strong>Transition plan</strong>\r\n\r\nTerry said his biggest concern, though, was not the cost. At one point, he even said he didn’t care about the cost. He’s worried that implementation will be a disaster. Not a completely unfounded concern given some other very high-profile healthcare implementations that didn’t go smoothly.\r\n\r\nICD-10 has the “potential to do irreparable harm to patients and physicians” if it is not implemented correctly, Terry said. He pushed for a dual coding system so that physicians have a year to get used to using ICD-10 before they get penalized for wrong codes.\r\n\r\nI thought it was very interesting how he kept coming back to the idea that physicians shouldn’t be penalized if they code incorrectly in ICD-10. My first thought was, well, you get penalized if you code wrong in ICD-9. Why should you get a pass in ICD-10?\r\n\r\nI understand his concern. We’ve been hearing for years about how small practices need to stash money away to carry them through any bumps in the transition. (Not sure how many small practices can afford to put money aside, but if you had started putting a little bit away three years again, you’d be in decent shape now.)\r\n\r\nI think some small practices will go out of business. No one really wants that to happen, but I think it will because not everyone is prepared. Not everyone will be ready October 1, 2015. We would still have people not ready if we pushed implementation to 2016, or 2017, or beyond, for that matter.\r\n\r\nI think his dual coding plan is a bad one. He proposed allowing physicians to decide whether to use ICD-9-CM or ICD-10-CM. He said physicians should get a year to practice with ICD-10 before they are forced to use it. Frighteningly enough, several of the subcommittee members embraced that idea.\r\n\r\nHere’s the thing. People will procrastinate. It’s human nature. If you don’t give people a drop-dead deadline, they put it off. If we did implement dual coding, who’s to say physician practices would actually use that time to prep for ICD-10?\r\n\r\nThe other problem I have with running dual coding systems is that it puts an unnecessary burden on the payers and researchers. Payers would have to keep two systems running to deal with the practices that don’t want to use ICD-10. They in essence would be doing double duty. That’s not fair. (I can’t believe I am sticking up for payers.)\r\n\r\nDual coding will also hinder research, which was another big topic of the hearing. Better data from ICD-10 means better tracking, better research, and eventually (not immediately) better patient care. If different people are using different systems, the data becomes less useful.\r\n\r\nEveryone on the subcommittee and all of the witnesses agreed we need ICD-10. So let’s end the suspense and make October 1, 2015, THE date.',

So far, so good. I love chocolate. I do not love crickets.

Instead, it was full of chrysanthemums and daisies. A-choo! Now I can’t stop sneezing. Why? I am allergic to chrysanthemums, daisies, jasmine, and wisteria. I now have a raging case of J30.1 (allergic rhinitis due to pollen). A-choo!\r\n\r\nThe second part of his romantic plans involved him rowing me down a scenic river in the local park.

Not to be deterred, my true love attempted to free his row boat and ended up in the water. Did I mention it’s really cold?\r\n\r\nFortunately for my true love, he wasn’t in the water long and only ended up with a mild case of T68.XXXA (hypothermia, initial encounter). When we code T68.XXXA, we also need to report a code to identify the source of exposure. For my true love, we would report X31.XXXA (exposure to excessive natural cold, initial encounter).\r\n\r\n<!--more-->You’ve probably noticed the proliferation of Xs in those two codes. Those Xs are not stand-ins for kisses, they are placeholders. Both codes are only three characters long, but require a seventh character to denote the encounter. Since the seventh character must be in the seventh position, we need to add Xs.\r\n\r\nSo much for a romantic afternoon.\r\n\r\nMy true love’s final chance to redeem himself was dinner Saturday night. He made reservations at a very nice restaurant (good job!), but when we got there for our 6 p.m. reservation, we were told we would have at least a two-hour wait. Okay, to be fair, I can’t blame my true love for this one.\r\n\r\nSince neither my true love nor I was in the mood to wait outside for two hours or leave and risk losing our place in line, we decided to go to the local mom and pop restaurant down the street. The food is usually good and, even better, we got a table within 10 minutes.\r\n\r\nRemember when I said the food was usually good? Saturday night was the exception. Oh, the meal tasted great and the raspberry mousse with vanilla sauce was to die for, almost literally. About 12 hours after dinner, my true love and I both experienced abdominal cramps, watery diarrhea, and nausea. Off to the Acme ED we went.\r\n\r\nDr. Hartless informed us that we were suffering from food poisoning, specifically botulism food poisoning (A05.1). Apparently we weren’t the only ones. That doesn’t make me feel better, Doc.\r\n\r\nAfter a few hours of treatment in the ED, we were given a clean bill of health and sent home.\r\n\r\nI am officially declaring this the Worst. Valentine’s. Day. EVER!',

For those not of a religious bent, it’s still a good reason for an all-day party.<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Mardi-gras-mask-800x536.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright  wp-image-4320\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Mardi-gras-mask-800x536-300x201.jpg\" alt=\"Mardi gras mask (800x536)\" width=\"396\" height=\"265\" /></a>\r\n\r\nHere at the Fix ‘Em Up Clinic, we have seen quite a few cases of partying gone bad. I’ve lost count of the number of times I have reported T51.0X1A (toxic effect of ethanol, accidental [unintentional], initial encounter), more commonly called alcohol poisoning.\r\n\r\nYou’ll find this code in the familiar looking Table of Drugs and Chemicals, but be sure you go to the Tabular List for the final code. Codes T51-T65 (Toxic effects of substances chiefly nonmedicinal as to source) include some important notes.\r\n\r\nThe first involves intent. The ICD-10-CM Table of Chemicals and Drugs clarifies the intent of the poisoning as:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Accidental</li>\r\n	<li>Intentional self-harm</li>\r\n	<li>Assault</li>\r\n	<li>Undetermined</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWhen no intent is indicated, code to accidental. You can only report undetermined intent when the provider documents in the record that he or she cannot determine the intent of the toxic effect.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->These codes also feature a note instructing us to use additional code(s) for all associated manifestations of toxic effects, such as:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Respiratory conditions due to external agents (J60-J70)</li>\r\n	<li>Personal history of foreign body fully removed (Z87.821)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe also find an Excludes1 note that tells us not to code contact with and (suspected) exposure to toxic substances (Z77.-) with codes from T51-T65. Remember, an Excludes1 note means the conditions are mutually exclusive. They can’t be reported together.\r\n\r\nNot all of our patients ingested too much alcohol, although alcohol may have been a contributing factor in Chrissy’s injury.\r\n\r\nChrissy’s company held a Mardi Gras party in the office, which included the distribution of Mardi Gras beads. One of Chrissy’s coworkers decided to twirl those beads and whipped them right into Chrissy’s face. Normally, you would just shrug it off, have some choice words with said coworker, and go about your day.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for Chrissy, one of the beads hit her in the eye and now she is suffering from blurry vision and pain in her eye.\r\n\r\nDr. Krewe examines Chrissy and diagnoses hyphema. ICD-10-CM divides hyphema into two types in two different sections of the <em>ICD-10-CM Manual</em>:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Hyphema (H21.0-)</li>\r\n	<li>Traumatic hyphema (S05.1-)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nDr. Krewe documented that Chrissy’s hyphema was caused by the bead hitting her in the eye, so we would report traumatic hyphema. We need a little more information to select the code.\r\n\r\nSubcategory S05.1- (contusion of eyeball and orbital tissues) includes traumatic hyphema as a subterm, so we know we’re in the right place. We also see an Excludes2 note for:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Black eye NOS (S00.1)</li>\r\n	<li>Contusion of eyelid and periocular area (S00.1)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThis is the second type of Excludes note in ICD-10-CM. Excludes2 means the excluded terms are not part of the code they are listed under, but the patient can have both at the same time. When they do, we’ll report two codes.\r\n\r\nFor example, if Dr. Krewe documented traumatic hyphema and a contusion of the eyelid for Chrissy, we would report both codes.\r\n\r\nTo select the appropriate code, we need to know which eye is involved and the encounter type. S05.1- does not include bilateral as a choice, so if both of Chrissy’s eye are injured, we would report two codes.\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM does give you an unspecified code, but I wouldn’t use it. Dr. Krewe really should be documenting the laterality.\r\n\r\nWe also need a seventh character for this code:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>A, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>D, subsequent encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S, sequela</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIf Chrissy was seen for an initial encounter for traumatic hyphema of the right eye, we would report S05.11XA. Don’t forget your placeholder to keep the encounter as the seventh character.\r\n\r\nLaissez les bons temps rouler.',

Does ICD-10-CM even have an equivalent, since 250.00 is very vague?\r\n\r\nYes, we do have a default code in ICD-10-CM for those times the physician just doesn’t document anything more than “diabetes”—it’s E11.9. Just like 250.00, E11.9 (type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications) doesn’t really tell us much.\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM includes a greater number of codes for diabetes than ICD-9-CM (which surprises no one). Many of the ICD-10-CM diabetes codes are combination codes that include information about the patient’s diabetes as well as any complications or manifestations. Obviously, E11.9 doesn’t include a lot of detail.\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM divides diabetes into five categories, up from the two we currently have in ICD-9-CM:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>E08, diabetes mellitus due to underlying condition</li>\r\n	<li>E09, drug- or chemical-induced diabetes mellitus</li>\r\n	<li>E10, type 1 diabetes mellitus</li>\r\n	<li>E11, type 2 diabetes mellitus</li>\r\n	<li>E13, other specified diabetes mellitus</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<!--more-->I’m not sure why ICD-10-CM skips category E12. Maybe they are leaving it for possible code expansion.\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM diabetes codes include subcategories for:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Ketoacidosis</li>\r\n	<li>Kidney complications</li>\r\n	<li>Ophthalmic complications</li>\r\n	<li>Neurological complications</li>\r\n	<li>Circulatory complications</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAll of this sounds great. We’re going to capture more information in one code, we can tell which type of diabetes the patient has, and we can stop haranguing physicians to document controlled or uncontrolled. Those terms aren’t used in ICD-10-CM, but if the physician documents poorly controlled or uncontrolled diabetes, you would report it with a code from the correct type of diabetes with hyperglycemia.\r\n\r\nIf Erin has poorly controlled type 2 diabetes, you would report E11.65 (type 2 diabetes mellitus with hyperglycemia).\r\n\r\nSuppose Erin also had a diabetic foot ulcer. We would also code E11.621 (type 2 diabetes mellitus with foot ulcer).\r\n\r\nBut we’re not done yet. Under code E11.621, we see a note instructing us to use an additional code to identify the site of ulcer (L97.1-L97.9, L98.41-L98.49). The difference in the two categories is location.\r\n\r\nIf the physician documents Erin’s ulcer is a diabetic ulcer of the right foot, we need to know which part of the foot. We also need to know the severity of the ulcer. In ICD-10-CM, non-pressure ulcer codes are also combination codes—you get the site and the stage all at once. The non-pressure ulcers include descriptions such as, \"limited to breakdown of the skin\", \"with necrosis of muscle\", etc.\r\n\r\nLet’s say the nurse documented that the fat layer is exposed on Erin’s right heel. We can take the stage from the nurse’s documentation, but not the site. The physician has to document the site. Because our physician knows that, she documents the right heel as the site.\r\n\r\nThat gives us code L97.412 (non-pressure chronic ulcer of right heel and midfoot with fat layer exposed).\r\n\r\nOne more thing to note about ICD-10-CM and diabetes—you can no longer assume a relationship between diabetes and gangrene or osteomyelitis. The physician needs to make the connection. <em>Coding Clinic, </em>Fourth Quarter 2013, p. 114, gave us that bad news.\r\n\r\nBe sure to keep an eye out for additional guidance between now and October 1.

What in the world could be wrong with Tobie?\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Doritos-800x612.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-4327\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Doritos-800x612-300x229.jpg\" alt=\"Doritos (800x612)\" width=\"300\" height=\"229\" /></a>Dr. H.M. Lock examines Tobie and first rules out a myocardial infarction. He also rules out a panic attack. Dr. Lock then considers an allergic reaction or poisoning. The question is, what substance was involved?\r\n\r\nTobie told Dr. Lock that she and her husband went on a date night to a Chinese restaurant Sunday night, then took the kids to a different Chinese restaurant last night. In between, Tobie confessed she consumed two (big) bags of chili cheese Doritos (because they were so tasty) and had leftover Chinese food for lunch.\r\n\r\nWith that information in hand, Dr. Lock diagnoses MSG poisoning.\r\n\r\nIf we look in the Table of Drugs and Chemicals in the <em>ICD-10-CM Manual</em> (it looks very similar to the one in the <em>ICD-9-CM Manual</em>), we do find an entry for monosodium glutamate. Note that you have to look for the whole term, not the abbreviation MSG.\r\n\r\nWe also need to know what type of poisoning Tobie suffered:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Accidental</li>\r\n	<li>Intentional self-harm</li>\r\n	<li>Assault</li>\r\n	<li>Undetermined</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<!--more-->ICD-10-CM does include two other choices in the Table of Drugs and Chemicals: adverse effect and underdosing. However, we don’t have options for those causes for MSG. That makes sense since MSG isn’t a therapeutic substance.\r\n\r\nWe’ll only use adverse effect when the patient takes a drug that was properly prescribed and appropriately administered. Underdosing is a new concept in ICD-10-CM. It again applies only to medication. For underdosing, the patient takes less of the medication than prescribed either intentionally (for example, it’s too expensive) or accidentally (because the patient has dementia and forgot to take the medication).\r\n\r\nWhich brings us back to poor Tobie, who was poisoned by MSG. Which type of poisoning did she suffer? Well, no one forced her to eat the Chinese food or the Doritos, so we can rule out assault. She wasn’t trying to kill herself, she was just enjoying some food. That eliminates intentional self-harm.\r\n\r\nDr. Lock didn’t document that the poisoning was accidental, so should we use accidental or undetermined? The default in ICD-10-CM is accidental. We would only use undetermined when the physician documents that he or she can’t determine the circumstances of the poisoning.\r\n\r\nFor example, the physician may not be sure if a patient was assaulted or intentionally took too much of a drug. That’s undetermined. Eating too much Chinese food and too many Doritos is accidental, which gives us code T65.891- on the table.\r\n\r\nSuper coders that we are, we know not to stop there. We still need to check the Tabular List for any additional characters and any notes. We find both.\r\n\r\nUnder T65 (toxic effects of other and unspecified substances) we see that we need a seventh character for the poisoning codes to denote the encounter. Since this is Tobie’s first visit for her MSG poisoning, we would use A (initial encounter), which makes our code T65.891A.\r\n\r\nBut wait, we’re not done yet. If you go all the way back to the beginning of the poisoning section (T36), you’ll see some other notes, including one to use additional codes to specify the manifestations of the poisoning.\r\n\r\nIn Tobie’s case, we would also code:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>R10.84, stomach cramps</li>\r\n	<li>R11.0, nausea</li>\r\n	<li>R42, light-headedness</li>\r\n	<li>R07.9, chest pain (unspecified chest pain)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSequence the poisoning code first, then all of the manifestations.\r\n\r\nFortunately for Tobie, in most cases MSG poisoning resolves on its own, so Dr. Lock sends her on her way with an admonition to go easy on the MSG in the future.',

Full performed a digital rectal exam, which showed good sphincter tone. Dr. Full then advanced a video colonoscope through Joe’s rectum and into the cecum. Dr. Full documented that the mucosa was normal looking throughout, but noted a few diverticula in the sigmoid colon. Dr. Full also identified a rectal polyp in the proximal rectum, approximately 5 mm in size. Dr. Full removed the polyp using hot biopsy technique and sent it off to the lab for a pathology report.\r\n\r\nThe pathology report stated, “hyperplastic polyp,” which is a benign growth, so Joe doesn’t need to worry about cancer today. However, Dr. Full does prescribe a high-fiber diet for Joe’s diverticulosis and tells Joe to schedule a follow-up colonoscopy in three years.\r\n\r\nHow would we code Joe’s surgery? Let’s start with the diagnosis codes. The first thing we know is Joe has a polyp. To select the correct ICD-10-CM code, we need to know the location (and we do)—in Joe’s case, in the rectum. When we look up polyp, rectal in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index, we find two choices:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Nonadenomatous, polyps with no malignant potential, including hyperplastic polyps, hamartomas, juvenile polyps, pseudopolyps, lipomas, and leiomyomas</li>\r\n	<li>Adenomatous, benign (noncancerous) growths that may be precursor lesions to colorectal cancer</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe know Joe’s polyp is hyperplastic, so we would report K62.1 (rectal polyp). Under K62.1, you’ll see an Excludes1 note. These notes tell you that the two conditions are mutually exclusive. You can’t code one with the other.\r\n\r\nSo you would never report K62.1 with D12.8 (adenomatous polyp). You always code to severity, so the cancer supersedes a benign polyp.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->Dr. Full also diagnosed Joe with diverticulosis (not to be confused with diverticulitis). Diverticulosis is a condition in which small pouches or pockets, known as diverticula, are present in the wall or lining of any portion of the digestive tract. When these diverticula become inflamed or infected, the condition becomes diverticulitis.\r\n\r\nTo code diverticulosis, we again need to know where the diverticula are located. Dr. Full documented diverticula in the sigmoid colon, which gives us K57.30 (diverticulosis of large intestine without perforation or abscess without bleeding).\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM includes additional codes that specify:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Without perforation or abscess with bleeding</li>\r\n	<li>With perforation and abscess with bleeding</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nMake sure your physicians are documenting this information.\r\n\r\nOn to Joe’s surgery. We know this is a surgical procedure, so we’re in the Medical and Surgical section (first character 0). We also know the rectum and large intestine are part of the gastrointestinal system, so our second character is D.\r\n\r\nTo select the correct root operation (third character), we need to know the intent of the procedure. What was Dr. Full trying to accomplish? He was removing a polyp. Five root operations involve removing all or part of a body part:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Excision, cutting out or off, without replacement, a portion of a body part</li>\r\n	<li>Resection, cutting out or off, without replacement, all of a body part</li>\r\n	<li>Detachment, cutting off all or part of the upper or lower extremities (not even an option for the gastrointestinal system, so we can eliminate it right off the bat)</li>\r\n	<li>Destruction, physical eradication of all or a portion of a body part by the direct use of energy, force, or a destructive agent</li>\r\n	<li>Extraction, pulling or stripping out or off all or a portion of a body part by the use of force</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nFirst of all, is a polyp a body part on its own or is it part of a body part? Here’s where a little clinical knowledge helps. An intestinal diverticulum is an outpouching of the wall of the gut to form a sac. So it’s not a separate body part, it’s part of the intestine that’s out of place, if you will. So we can eliminate Resection.\r\n\r\nThat leaves Destruction, Excision, and Extraction. Back to the op report. Dr. Full documented using a “hot biopsy technique” to remove the polyp. This technique involves grasping the mucosa, tenting it into the GI lumen, and heating for 1–2 seconds. Dr. Full is cutting off the polyp, so our root operation is Excision (third character B).\r\n\r\nOur fourth character specifies the body part, in this case the rectum (P). That’s where the polyp lived.\r\n\r\nWhat approach did Dr. Full use? In ICD-10-PCS table 0DB, we have five possible approaches:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Open</li>\r\n	<li>Percutaneous</li>\r\n	<li>Percutaneous endoscopic</li>\r\n	<li>Via natural or artificial opening</li>\r\n	<li>Via natural or artificial opening endoscopic</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nHow did Dr. Full get to the polyp? He went in through a natural opening (the rectum) using a video colonoscope. The video colonoscope helped Dr. Full visualize the colon, which means the approach is via natural or artificial opening endoscopic (fifth character 8).\r\n\r\nThe sixth character is easy. Our only choice is X.\r\n\r\nWhat about the qualifier (seventh character)? X for diagnostic or Z for no qualifier? Again, look at the intent of the procedure. Dr. Full did send the polyp to pathology for examination, but his intent wasn’t to just take a biopsy and wait to decide whether to remove the polyp. The polyp was coming out regardless of whether it was malignant or benign. Seventh character is Z.\r\n\r\nThat gives us a final code of 0DBP8ZZ.\r\n\r\nJoe is discharged, his record is coded, and we are done for the week!',

The chairman is seeking support from his colleagues in Congress, according to an email from Margarita Valdez, senior director of Congressional relations for AHIMA.\r\n\r\nAHIMA is urging HIM professionals to call Rep. Michael Burgess, R-Texas, at (202) 225-7772 and state that you support ICD-10 implementation in 2015.\r\n\r\nHere are some talking points from AHIMA:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>We need the code sets in 2015!</li>\r\n	<li>A <a href=\"http://www.justcoding.com/313031/healthcare-news-gao-reports-on-cms-icd10-preparations\">recent GAO report</a> supports ICD-10 readiness.</li>\r\n	<li>Small physician practices are expected to spend between $1,900 and $6,000 to transition to the new code set. This is much lower than previous reports. The study can be found on www.coalitionforICD10.org.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<!--more-->You can also mention the House Energy and Commerce Committee’s subcommittee on health’s <a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/2015/02/costs-transition-plan-focus-of-house-hearing-on-icd-10/\">ICD-10 Implementation hearing</a> February 11. During the testimony, the subcommittee’s members heard from seven industry stakeholders, six of whom supported ICD-10 implementation in 2015. Many members of the subcommittee agreed that the U.S. needs ICD-10, and it should not be delayed any further.\r\n\r\nThen call the other congressional leaders also. AHIMA helpfully provided their names and phone numbers:\r\n\r\nSessions: (202) 225-2231\r\n\r\nRep. Virginia Foxx (R-North Carolina): (202) 225-2071\r\n\r\nRep.

Louise Slaughter (D-NY): (202) 225-3615\r\n\r\nIf you tweet, you can also find their Twitter handles very easily online, for example, @michaelcburgess and @PeteSessions.\r\n\r\nMake sure Congress knows we support ICD-10 in 2015!',

That’s not an unusual or completely unexpected outcome. Scientists have known for some time that genetics plays a role in autism. The new study suggests genetic influences on autism to be between 74%--98%. You have to be a <em>JAMA Psychiatry</em> subscriber to read the complete article, but <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/health-31713147\">BBC News</a> helpfully reported on the findings.\r\n\r\nWhile scientists and physicians aren’t sure of the exact cause of autism, they—and the general public—do know that physicians are more commonly diagnosing autism. Keep in mind that autism is a spectrum of disorders, not a single condition. Some patients are mildly impaired by their symptoms, while others are severely disabled.\r\n\r\nICD-9-CM offers one code for autism with two possible fifth digits:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>299.00, autistic disorder, current or active state</li>\r\n	<li>299.01, autistic disorder, residual state</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIf the state is unspecified, default to 0.\r\n\r\nWe do have one additional code choice for Asperger’s syndrome—299.8x (other specified pervasive developmental disorder). You will use either a 0 or 1 as the fifth digit just as you do for autism.\r\n\r\nSince ICD-10-CM is more detailed, you might expect to find more code choices. Actually, you don’t.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->In ICD-10-CM, we will report F84.0 (autistic disorder) for patients diagnosed with autism.\r\n\r\nUnder F84.0, we see an Excludes1 note for Asperger’s syndrome. Excludes1 means the conditions are mutually exclusive. If the patient has one, he or she can’t have the other. As usual, that makes perfect sense in this case. Asperger’s syndrome is part of the autism spectrum.\r\n\r\nIn ICD-10-CM, we’ll use F84.5 for Asperger\'s syndrome.\r\n\r\nAtypical autism falls under F84.9 (pervasive developmental disorder, unspecified).\r\n\r\nOne difference with ICD-10-CM is the “Use additional code” note under F84.0. The note instructs us to identify any associated medical condition and intellectual disabilities with an additional code (or codes, depending on the patient’s condition).\r\n\r\nWe don’t have that note in ICD-9-CM, so in ICD-10-CM, we will get a better understanding of the patient’s level of impairment.',

Our friends over at the <a href=\"http://www.hcpro.com/acdis/\">Association of Clinical Documentation Improvement Specialists</a> spend their professional lives working to get more precise, detailed, accurate, no-room-for-interpretation documentation.\r\n\r\nWhy all the fuss about specificity? Different people interpret things different ways. My colleagues sometimes hate me for playing devil’s advocate and saying, someone could take that to mean Y instead of X.\r\n\r\nRelevant case in point: Earlier this week, AHIMA emailed its members imploring them to call members of Congress to oppose an ICD-10 delay. AHIMA’s Margarita Valdez, senior director of Congressional relations, heard that Chairman of the House Rules Committee Pete Sessions, R-Texas, was drafting (or looking to draft) language for another ICD-10 delay.\r\n\r\nMy colleague Steve Andrews reached out to Sessions’ office asking for verification. In very short order, a member of Sessions’ staff replied that the Congressman is meeting with physicians about their concerns regarding ICD-10, but no legislation has been drafted.\r\n\r\nI also heard from a blog reader who told me she had spoken to a staff member for Rep. Rob Woodall, R-Ga. That staff member had spoken to Sessions\' staff, who told him that Sessions has no plans at present to introduce legislation for another delay of ICD-10. (That’s a massive amount of hearsay, because it’s at best fourth-hand information, but still, we’ll take what we can get for now.)\r\n\r\nAt first glance, that looks like a win. No legislation, no delay, right? Not exactly. Here’s where playing devil’s advocate comes in.\r\n\r\nSessions had not drafted legislation and has no plans to introduce legislation. However, no one claimed Sessions isn’t looking to add language to an existing (or future) bill to delay ICD-10. It’s nitpicking, but we are talking about politicians.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->The whole discussion may have started <a href=\"https://www.isms.org/Governmental_Affairs/Letters_and_Testimony/ISMS_Joins_Call_for_Cautious_ICD-10_Transition/\">with a letter</a> that the AMA and 99 specialty societies sent to Andrew Slavitt, acting administrator of CMS, detailing a “number of concerns that do not appear to be addressed” by CMS’ current transition plan.\r\n\r\nFair enough, we’re all worried about certain parts of the transition.\r\n\r\nThe medical groups want CMS to release more detailed end-to-end testing results broken out by:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Type and size of providers who tested</li>\r\n	<li>Number of claims tested by each submitter</li>\r\n	<li>Percentage of claims successfully processed</li>\r\n	<li>Specific details about problems encountered</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThat seems reasonable to me. The more we know about what worked and what didn’t, the better we can prepare.\r\n\r\nThings get a little murkier near the end of the letter when it talks about code specificity. The AMA has been beating this drum for a while now because the increased specificity requires more detailed documentation. The detail, though, is one of the main strengths of ICD-10. We can get a better picture of the patient’s health, and with ICD-10-PCS, we’ll actually know what specific procedure the physician performed.\r\n\r\nAccording to the letter:\r\n\r\n<em>CMS officials have stated that, absent indications of potential fraud or intent to purposefully bill incorrectly, CMS will not instruct its contractors to audit claims to verify that the most appropriate ICD-10 code was used. There is also general concern about how physicians will be audited as they learn to use the new code set. We urge CMS to: 1) confirm and broadly educate stakeholders and contractors that claims will not be audited simply for code specificity; and 2) to instruct contractors that they are prohibited from engaging in audits that are only predicated on code specificity.</em>\r\n\r\nI was kind of appalled by the apparent unconcern for specificity. Then I reread it and found it’s not so much appalling as it is vague. Then I went back to the source of the \"no audit\" statement, the Government Accountability Report <a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/assets/670/668128.pdf\">on CMS’ preparation for ICD-10 implementation</a>. According to that report:\r\n\r\n<em>CMS officials stated that the submission of valid ICD-10 codes is a requirement for payment; however, when the presence of a specific diagnosis code is not required for payment then the claim would be paid even if a more appropriate ICD-10 code should have been used on the claim. </em>\r\n\r\nIn a way that makes sense. You could go to the physician’s office for a cold or a bad cut or just for your annual physical. In order to use the CPT® code for an office visit, you don’t need a particular ICD-10-CM code. You just need the code that will support medical necessity for that service. So if a patient is seen for S50.311A (abrasion of right elbow, initial encounter), you probably won’t get away with reporting CPT code 99215 (level 5 established patient visit).\r\n\r\nThe GAO report further stated:\r\n\r\n<em>Additionally, CMS officials indicated that, absent indications of potential fraud or intent to purposefully bill incorrectly, CMS will not instruct its contractors to audit claims specifically to verify that the most appropriate ICD-10 code was used. However, audits will continue to occur and could identify ICD-10 codes included erroneously on claims which could lead to claims denials, according to CMS officials.</em>\r\n\r\nThe devil is in the details and the word choice. The GAO report states: “CMS <strong>will not instruct</strong> its contractors to audit claims specifically to verify that the most appropriate ICD-10 code was used.”\r\n\r\nThe medical societies’ letter uses different wording that actually doesn’t reflect what CMS said. The letter uses the phrase, “claims <strong>will not be audited</strong> simply for code specificity.”\r\n\r\nBased on what CMS actually said, auditors could still go and look specifically for specificity. I wouldn’t be surprised if some third-party payer auditors did.\r\n\r\nNote that CMS also said it will audit claims and the audit process itself could identify erroneous codes. It never details what makes the code erroneous, so theoretically, auditors could say the code is wrong because it’s not specific enough.\r\n\r\nWe also don’t know how or if CMS will reimburse for unspecified codes. You can absolutely use unspecified codes when they best reflect what is known at the time of the patient encounter or if the physician just doesn’t know what’s wrong. You can also use them when the physician doesn\'t know the causative organism of a disease.\r\n\r\nFor example, a patient comes in with stuffy head, congestion, and wheezing. The physician listens to the patient’s complaint, her breathing, and her lungs, then diagnoses acute bronchitis. ICD-10-CM includes 10 codes for bronchitis, but in this case, you can report the unspecified one. The physician shouldn’t do a test just to get a more specific code.\r\n\r\nGreat, but what happens with E11.9? That’s the incredibly non-specific code for diabetes. In ICD-9-CM, it’s 250.00. Will CMS and other payers accept E11.9? If they do initially, how long will they continue to do so? Moving to a more specific code set does us no good if we don’t get more specific documentation.\r\n\r\nWords matter and so does context. Make sure you read reports about ICD-10 as critically as you do physician documentation.',

They had a great time. Aunt Melissa, however, didn’t escape the adventure unscathed. While descending the (not really) deadly slope, Melissa and 10-year-old Eamonn went off course and headed toward a tree. Being the brave aunt, Melissa managed to turn the sled just enough so she only smashed her thumb into the tree. Eamonn escaped injury (except to his pride—he was the only one not to make it the whole way down the hill).\r\n\r\nMelissa thought nothing of her mashed thumb until three days later when it was so bruised and swollen her coworker hounded her to go to the Fix ‘Em Up Clinic.\r\n\r\nDr. Frosty examines Melissa and documents significant swelling and bruising, as well as tenderness and pain. He sends her for an x-ray to rule out a thumb fracture and instructs her to come back the following day. In his documentation, he lists the diagnosis as “rule out thumb fracture.”\r\n\r\nWhat can we code for Melissa’s visit? Since she was seen on an outpatient basis, we cannot code a thumb fracture because the diagnosis was not established. If she had been an inpatient, we could code the rule out, probable, and suspected diagnoses as if they were present (see the<em> <a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/ICD10/Downloads/icd10cm-guidelines-2015.pdf\">ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting, II.G</a></em>).\r\n\r\nThat means we need to code Melissa’s symptoms. But first, we need to know which thumb Melissa injured. ICD-10-CM specifies laterality for hands (arms, legs, eyes, ears, etc.). All of the codes that include laterality also include an unspecified option, but you shouldn’t need them. Physicians should already be documenting that information.\r\n\r\nAnd Dr. Frosty did. When we review his notes, we learn Melissa mashed her right thumb.\r\n\r\nSince we don’t have a definitive diagnosis of a fracture, we can only code for the established diagnosis, which in Melissa’s case is a contusion. Dr. Frosty did not mention any damage to the nail, so we would report S60.011A (contusion of right thumb without damage to nail, initial encounter).\r\n\r\nMelissa is off to schedule an x-ray for her thumb and hope nothing’s broken.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;',

Coyote, Friday the 13<sup>th</sup> has not been kind to our favorite super genius.\r\n\r\nWile E. arrived at the Acme ED decidedly the worse for wear after his latest encounter with a certain speedy bird and another less-than-stellar Acme product.\r\n\r\nWile E. purchased roller skis in an attempt to increase his speed and allow him to nab his choice of prey. At first, things looked pretty good. Wile E. was in hot pursuit of his prospective dinner when said meal made a U-turn at the end of a cliff. Sadly, Wile E. did not see the cliff edge coming and continued to ski forward into space.\r\n\r\nHe maintained enough momentum that he initially appeared likely to land safely on the cliff across the way. However, this being Friday the 13<sup>th</sup> and Wile E. being the unluckiest coyote to ever live, gravity got the better of him. Instead of landing on the smooth top of the opposite cliff, he slammed into the side. To make matters worse, he then plummeted to the bottom of the gorge.\r\n\r\nAt the Acme ED, Dr. Frankenbean undertook a thorough examination of Wile E.’s wounds.\r\n\r\nAccording to Dr. Frankenbean’s documentation, Wile E. suffered multiple facial fractures consistent with hitting a rock wall at speed. So we have some traumatic fractures. The question is, which bones did Wile E. break?\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM does include a code for unspecified fracture of facial bones (S02.92-) and if you look up fracture, face, that’s where the Alphabetic Index sends you. But is that the best code to use?\r\n\r\n<!--more-->Not really. ICD-10-CM includes specific codes for the different bones of the face, such as:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Nasal bones (S02.2-)</li>\r\n	<li>Orbital floor (S02.3-)</li>\r\n	<li>Malar, maxillary, and zygoma bones (S02.4-)</li>\r\n	<li>Tooth (traumatic) (S02.5-)</li>\r\n	<li>Mandible (S02.6-)</li>\r\n	<li>Other specified skull and facial bones (S02.8-)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSome of these subcategories are further divided to provide more specificity on the actual bone and type of fracture. In addition, all of them require a seventh character to denote the encounter.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, fractures aren’t the worst of Wile E.’s problems. Dr. Frankenbean also documented a subdural hematoma. A subdural hematoma is a collection of blood outside the brain. The bleeding in a subdural hematoma is under the skull and outside the brain, not in the brain itself.\r\n\r\nWith a traumatic subdural hemorrhage, we also need to know about any loss of consciousness. ICD-10-CM includes 10 different codes for a traumatic subdural hemorrhage, more when you remember to add the seventh character.\r\n\r\nIf you look in the Tabular List under S06.5- (traumatic subdural hemorrhage), you won’t find a note about the seventh character. You have to go all the way back to the main category, S06 (intracranial injury) to find these notes:\r\n\r\nIncludes: traumatic brain injury\r\n\r\nCode also any associated:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Open wound of head (S01.-)</li>\r\n	<li>Skull fracture (S02.-)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nExcludes1:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Head injury NOS (S09.90)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe appropriate seventh character is to be added to each code from category S06\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>A, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>D, subsequent encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S, sequela</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese notes apply to all of the subcategories under S06.\r\n\r\nIn his notes, Dr. Frankenbean documented a traumatic subdural hematoma with a loss of consciousness of 48 minutes. We know this is Wile E.’s first visit for these injuries, so we would report S06.5X2A (traumatic subdural hemorrhage with loss of consciousness of 31 minutes to 59 minutes, initial encounter).\r\n\r\nDr. Frankenbean is taking a wait and see approach to treating Wile E.’s hematoma, so he is ordering observation for the coyote. We’ll check back on Wile E. next week to see how he’s doing. In the meantime, watch out for black cats, ladders, and umbrellas opened indoors.',

Coyote is headed for surgery. As you might recall, Wile E. suffered a <a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/2015/03/a-bad-day-to-be-a-genius/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+icd-10watch+%28ICD-10+Trainer%29\">subdural hematoma following a collision with a cliff</a> on Friday the 13th. Dr. Frankenbean decided to try conservative treatment first, but alas, our favorite super genius is not bouncing back from this latest injury.\r\n\r\nA CT scan showed a 6.6 mm subdural hematoma and Wile E. is showing significant lethargy and confusion. Dr. Frankenbean has decided that he needs to evacuate the hematoma.\r\n\r\nHow will Dr. Frankenbean perform this procedure? Actually, let’s back up a step. What procedure will Dr. Frankenbean perform? He can elect to drill a burr hole in Wile E.’s skull and suction out the hematoma. Or he could decide to perform a craniotomy, which creates a larger opening in the skull.\r\n\r\nAs a historical aside, burr holes and craniotomies have literally been around since prehistoric times. Forty of 120 skulls found at one burial site in France dated to 6500 B.C. show evidence of this type of procedure, formerly called trepanation.\r\n\r\nDr. Frankenbean decides to perform a craniotomy and evacuation procedure on Wile E. and transfers the patient to the Stitch ‘Em Up Hospital. Brain surgeries are inpatient procedures and if you check CMS’ inpatient-only list, you’ll find most brain surgery codes, including those for craniotomies, on that list.\r\n\r\nSo we know Wile E. will meet medical necessity for this inpatient admission. What would his principal diagnosis be? S06.5X2A (traumatic subdural hemorrhage with loss of consciousness of 31 minutes to 59 minutes, initial encounter).\r\n\r\nHow do we know that? When Wile E. arrived at the Acme ED Friday, Dr. Frankenbean documented a traumatic subdural hematoma with a loss of consciousness of 48 minutes. Wile E. was in observation before being admitted as an inpatient, so we’re still using the same ICD-10-CM code. Even if Dr. Frankenbean had discharged Wile E. and the coyote returned because he wasn’t feeling better, we would still use S06.5X2A. We will use the seventh character A when the patient is receiving active treatment, including surgery.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->Speaking of the surgery, let’s see what Dr. Frankenbean is doing.\r\n\r\nAfter Wile E. is put under general anesthesia, Dr. Frankenbean removes a small section of Wile E.’s skull and opens the covering of the brain. He locates the clot and evacuates it using suction and irrigation then places a drain that will remain in Wile E. Dr. Frankenbean replaces the bone and secures it using titanium screws. The surgical counts are correct and Wile E. is sent to recovery.\r\n\r\nIn ICD-9-CM Volume 3, we have a very generic code for this procedure: 01.2 (craniotomy and craniectomy).\r\n\r\nWhen we get to ICD-10-PCS, our code will tell us a lot more information. First of all, we are in the Medical and Surgical section, so our first character is 0 (the number zero, not a capital O). We know we are performing brain surgery, but is the body section “Head and Facial Bones” or “Central Nervous System”?\r\n\r\nMaybe the ICD-10-PCS Alphabetic Index can help us out here. If you look up “craniotomy” the index directs you to:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>See Division, Head and Facial Bones 0NQ</li>\r\n	<li>See Drainage, Central Nervous System 009</li>\r\n	<li>See Drainage, Head and Facial Bones 0N9</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nOK, no help there on the body section. We do get some help on the root operation though, because the index narrows it down to two.\r\n\r\nBut before we get to the root operation, we need to figure out the body system. Where is Dr. Frankenbean performing the procedure? Is it a procedure on the bone or a procedure on the brain? He’s removing fluid from the subarachnoid space, so it\'s the area between the bone and the brain.\r\n\r\nIf you look at table 009, you’ll see a body part character for the subdural space (fourth character 4). That’s where Dr. Frankenbean is operating, so our body system is Central Nervous System (second character 0).\r\n\r\nOur root operation will be Drainage (third character 9), taking or letting out fluids and/or gases from a body part. In Wile E.’s case, Dr. Frankenbean is removing an accumulation of blood, so Drainage fits.\r\n\r\nNext, we need to know the approach. We have three choices:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>0, open: cutting through the skin or mucous membrane and any other body layers necessary to expose the site of the procedure</li>\r\n	<li>3, percutaneous: entry, by puncture or minor incision, of instrumentation through the skin or mucous membrane and any other body layers necessary to reach the site of the procedure</li>\r\n	<li>4, percutaneous endoscopic: entry, by puncture or minor incision, of instrumentation through the skin or mucous membrane and any other body layers necessary to reach and visualize the site of the procedure</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nDr. Frankenbean documented removing part of the skull to visualize the blood clot, so our approach is open.\r\n\r\nOur sixth and seventh characters are easy because we only have one choice for each:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>0, drainage device</li>\r\n	<li>Z, no qualifier</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nA quick reminder about devices in ICD-10-PCS. You only report a device is when it will remain permanently in the patient. These include:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Grafts and prostheses</li>\r\n	<li>Implants</li>\r\n	<li>Simple or mechanical appliances</li>\r\n	<li>Electronic appliances</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe <em>ICD-10-PCS Manual</em> includes a device aggregation table (Appendix D). The table crosswalks the specific device values created for specific root operations and specific body parts to general device characters used for root operations that represent a broad range of procedures and general body part values.\r\n\r\nOur final code for Wile E. is 009400Z (drainage of subdural space with drainage device, open approach).\r\n\r\nWe wish Wile E. a speedy recovery.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;',

Turns out it’s not a good idea to try and make Guinness green. It requires an excessive amount of green dye.\r\n\r\nAs a result, Liam ended up suffering from:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>0X1A, toxic effect of ethanol, accidental (unintentional), initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>6X1A, toxic effect of paints and dyes, not elsewhere classified, accidental (unintentional), initial encounter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou’ll find those codes by looking in the Table of Chemicals and Drugs, just like you do in ICD-9-CM.\r\n\r\nHowever, Liam decided a little poisoning was not going to deter him from his pursuit of fame and fortune (mostly fortune). So he headed back out to follow the rainbow only he could see. Hmm, perhaps Liam also has a little R44.1 (visual hallucinations) going on.\r\n\r\nThe (imaginary) rainbow leads him into the deep, dark woods, where instead of finding a friendly leprechaun, he encounters some decidedly less friendly woodland creatures. Or at least that’s his story when he arrives back at the Fix ‘Em Up Clinic with numerous bite marks, abrasions, and lacerations.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->ICD-10-CM groups injuries in Chapter 19 (Injury, poisoning, and certain other consequences of external causes [S00-T88]) by site, not by type of injury like ICD-9-CM. If Liam suffered different types of injuries to, say his forearms, we would report codes from S50-S59. You’ll find lacerations, contusions, open bites, blisters, punctures, and fractures (among others) involving the forearms in this range of codes.\r\n\r\nNote that the codes specify laterality and encounter, so make sure you physician is documenting that information.\r\n\r\nDon’t forget your external cause codes (if your payer requires them). The external cause codes (formerly known as E codes) tell you:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>How the injury happened</li>\r\n	<li>Where it happened</li>\r\n	<li>What the patient was doing when it happened</li>\r\n	<li>Whether the injury was intentional</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nFor Liam’s trip into the woods, we could report:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>51XA, bitten by raccoon (we also have codes for squirrel, cow, pig, horse, rat, mouse, assorted birds, dogs, cats, and the always popular “other”)</li>\r\n	<li>82A, forest as the place of occurrence of the external cause</li>\r\n	<li>01, activity, walking, marching and hiking (sadly, we do not have a code for tracking leprechauns)</li>\r\n	<li>8, other external cause status (again, we lack a code for searching for gold or little green men)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nLiam is nothing if not determined, so he heads back to the woods, but gets sidetracked on the way by a field of clover. What better way to relax than to look for a lucky four-leaf clover, right? Unless you stumble into a patch of poison ivy and you, like Liam, happen to be extremely allergic to poison ivy.\r\n\r\nBack to the clinic he comes, suffering from L23.7 (allergic contact dermatitis due to plants, except food). ICD-10-CM helpfully includes a range of causes for allergic contact dermatitis, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Metals</li>\r\n	<li>Adhesives</li>\r\n	<li>Cosmetics</li>\r\n	<li>Drugs in contact with skin</li>\r\n	<li>Dyes</li>\r\n	<li>Other chemical products</li>\r\n	<li>Food in contact with skin</li>\r\n	<li>Other agents</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nDon’t know what caused the condition? We’ve got a code for that as well: L23.9 (allergic contact dermatitis, unspecified cause). You may hesitate to report an unspecified code, but in some cases, unspecified is the most appropriate code available. Liam may have no idea what he touched that caused the allergic reaction. Instead of forcing the physician to perform multiple tests to determine a cause, ICD-10-CM tells us to use the unspecified code.\r\n\r\nI don’t know about you, but I am experiencing some R53.83 (other fatigue) just looking at Liam’s chart. I think I’ll go have a bowl of Lucky Charms and some Jameson’s and call it a day.',

Shortly before Christmas, she stubbed her toe, really hard. However, no bruise appeared and her toe didn’t swell up, so she thought nothing of it. Three weeks later, she stretched her feet in bed and felt excruciating pain in the toe.\r\n\r\nShe came into the Fix ‘Em Up Clinic to see Dr. Setter, who confirmed that Wendy had fractured her toe. Dr. Setter provided a special shoe for Wendy to wear and told her to rest the foot as much as possible.\r\n\r\nThree months later, Wendy’s broken toe hasn’t healed so she is back to see Dr. Setter. Wendy told Dr. Setter that because of the bad winter weather she was unable to wear the special shoe all of the time. She also stated that she is occasionally bothered by pain in the toe.\r\n\r\nDr. Setter ordered a new set of x-rays to make sure Wendy did not fracture the toe a second time. After comparing the old and new x-rays, Dr. Setter documents that the fracture is the same one Wendy suffered in December. He noted that the fracture is non-healing and is considering more aggressive treatment, including possible surgery.\r\n\r\nHow would we code Wendy’s fracture in ICD-10-CM? Basically, the same way we would have coded it in December, just with a new seventh character.\r\n\r\nFor fractures, we need to know:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Laterality</li>\r\n	<li>Specific site</li>\r\n	<li>Encounter</li>\r\n	<li>Open or closed</li>\r\n	<li>Displaced or non-displaced</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe can gather some of this information from the x-ray that Dr. Setter reviewed. For example, the x-ray report identifies the fracture as a non-displaced fracture of the medial phalanx of the second right toe.\r\n\r\nWe don’t have any documentation that identifies the fracture as open or closed, but we do have a default (closed) in ICD-10-CM.\r\n\r\nFor a closed, non-displaced fracture of the medial phalanx of a right lesser toe, we would report S92.524-.\r\n\r\nNow we have to decide which seventh character to use. For all codes in category S92 (fractures of the foot and toe, except ankle) we have seven possible seventh characters:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>A, initial encounter for closed fracture</li>\r\n	<li>B, initial encounter for open fracture</li>\r\n	<li>D, subsequent encounter for fracture with routine healing</li>\r\n	<li>G, subsequent encounter for fracture with delayed healing</li>\r\n	<li>K, subsequent encounter for fracture with nonunion</li>\r\n	<li>P, subsequent encounter for fracture with malunion</li>\r\n	<li>S, sequela</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe can eliminate B (we’re dealing with a closed fracture) and D (obviously, the fracture isn’t healing normally).\r\n\r\nWhat about A? The Official Guidelines for ICD-10-CM Coding and Reporting instruct us to use A (and B) when the patient is receiving active treatment, such as:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Surgical treatment</li>\r\n	<li>Emergency department encounter</li>\r\n	<li>Evaluation and treatment by a new physician</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nDr. Setter documents that he may need to operate on Wendy’s toe, but he isn’t doing it at this visit. He is also not a new physician and Wendy is not in the ED. So we can eliminate A.\r\n\r\nA sequela is a late effect, something that shows up after an injury heals. It also isn’t a choice in this case because Wendy’s fracture hasn’t healed.\r\n\r\nThat leaves us with three choices for a subsequent visit:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Delayed healing</li>\r\n	<li>Nonunion</li>\r\n	<li>Malunion</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe can also eliminate malunion. A malunion is a fracture that healed but in less than an optimal position. Again, Wendy’s fracture hasn’t healed so it can’t be a malunion.\r\n\r\nNow things get tricky. Delayed healing and nonunion are very close in definition.\r\n\r\nA nonunion occurs when a fracture fails to heal, according to the <a href=\"http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/topic.cfm?topic=A00374\">American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons</a>. Delayed union or healing is when a fracture takes longer than usual to heal.\r\n\r\nDr. Setter documented “non-healing” which is kind of a hybrid term. We may need to query Dr. Setter for clarification because ICD-10-CM doesn’t give us any information on how to differentiate between the two.',

He came back with some cool photos and a broken ankle. Apparently, the parking lot at the beach did him in even before he hit the surf.\r\n\r\nJeff saw an ED physician in Hawaii, who diagnosed a non-displaced trimalleolar fracture of the left ankle. The physician treated Jeff and instructed him to follow up with his primary care physician on the mainland.\r\n\r\nThe coder reported ICD-10-CM code S82.855A for Jeff’s ED visit.\r\n\r\nJeff came in to see Dr. Breaker at the Fix ‘Em Up Clinic for follow-up care for the fracture. Dr. Breaker ordered x-rays to check the healing of the fracture and documented:\r\n\r\n<em>Saw patient three weeks post non-displaced trimalleolar fracture of the left ankle. Ordered x-rays. Bone shows normal healing. Instructed patient to return in three weeks. </em>\r\n\r\n<!--more-->Based on Dr. Breaker’s documentation, we know we are still using S82.855- as our base code because she documented all of the pertinent information—laterality, type of fracture, non-displaced. Remember that we can’t go back to previous notes to find this information. The physician has to document it for this visit.\r\n\r\nThe question now becomes, which seventh character do we use? Should we report A for initial treatment because Jeff is seeing a new physician? Or should we go with D (subsequent encounter for fracture with routine healing) because Dr. Setter just checked the healing status of the fracture? And does it matter that she ordered x-rays?\r\n\r\nThe correct seventh character is D. We’ll choose our seventh character based on the care the patient received and not on whether the patient is seeing a new or different physician.\r\n\r\nThat’s a little bit of a change from the early days of ICD-10-CM when the <em>Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting </em>instructed us to use A for evaluation and management by a new physician. Now the physician doesn’t matter. It’s all about the patient care.\r\n\r\nIf Dr. Setter needed to reset the break or provide some other type of active treatment, then we would use A. ICD-10-CM considers x-rays to be routine follow up.',

But don’t worry, you won’t feel any pain or other physical manifestations of the syndrome. Just that loud noise inside your head.\r\n\r\nDoctors don’t know for sure what causes exploding head syndrome, but it may be related to stress and fatigue, according to the <a href=\"https://www.sleepassociation.org/patients-general-public/exploding-head-syndrome/\">American Sleep Association</a>. Doctors also aren’t sure what causes the noise.\r\n\r\nIf we have a patient suffering from exploding head syndrome, how would we code it?\r\n\r\nI looked up <em>syndrome, head</em>, and <em>syndrome, exploding head,</em> in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index.

We may need to get our CDI friends involved. They may be able to give us some other terms to look up. Barring that, we may need to query the physicians.\r\n\r\nFortunately, our CDI specialist Suzie told us that exploding head syndrome is a parasomnia event. ICD-10-CM offers these choices for parasomnia:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>G47.50, parasomnia, unspecified</li>\r\n	<li>G47.51, confusional arousals</li>\r\n	<li>G47.52, REM sleep behavior disorder</li>\r\n	<li>G47.53, recurrent isolated sleep paralysis</li>\r\n	<li>G47.54, parasomnia in conditions classified elsewhere</li>\r\n	<li>G47.59, other parasomnia</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nFor exploding head syndrome, we would use G47.59 because we know what the condition is, but we don’t have a more specific code.

Woo-hoo!\r\n\r\nIn other good news, CMS seems ready to process ICD-10 claims, based on the first round of end-to-end testing. I am curious to see how the second and third rounds go and I’d love to see some more details, but hey, at least CMS is successfully testing.\r\n\r\nNow the bad news. We only have six months until ICD-10 implementation. That means we have six months to iron out all of the bugs, make sure everyone is trained and ready, and be prepared for the inevitable problems.\r\n\r\nSo, it’s time to imitate Santa by making a list and checking it twice.\r\n\r\nHere are some thoughts for what should be on your list:<!--more-->\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>How well are your coders trained? Have they been practicing on actual records? Do you know what kind of productivity hit you’re facing and have you made plans to address it?</li>\r\n	<li>How’s your EHR? Do the physicians like it? (Okay, they probably don’t, so a better question is, can they use it?) Have you talked with your vendor about upgrades/updates for ICD-10? Can they add prompts or templates into the system to help capture additional documentation required for ICD-10?</li>\r\n	<li>Are your physicians on board with ICD-10? It’s easy to say all physicians hate ICD-10 because the AMA keeps trying to kill it. But don’t rely on the AMA’s stance to tell you what your physicians think. They may love ICD-10 and be ready to go October 1. At the very least, you need to make sure physicians are educated on what will change for their specialty October 1. For example, talk to your OB/GYNs about documenting weeks gestation. Skip that conversation with the pulmonologists. Tell them about the new asthma codes, which align more with the disease process.</li>\r\n	<li>Are your queries ready? Has your clinical documentation improvement (CDI) team reviewed their queries to make sure they are capturing ICD-10 information? Hopefully, they’ve been updating queries for a while and the physicians are getting used to documenting additional information.</li>\r\n	<li>Does your query process work? That seems like a no-brainer, but now is a good time to assess whether your process is efficient and effective. How long does it take physicians to respond to queries? What is the overall response rate? Is physician behavior changing for the better with queries? For example, several years ago, CDI specialists began querying for bacterial pneumonia. In some cases, physicians began documenting bacterial pneumonia for every patient to avoid a query.</li>\r\n	<li>And while we’re on the subject of queries, are you ready to query for surgical procedures? Coders are going to need very specific information to report procedures using ICD-10-PCS. Is that information currently in the operative report? If not, do your CDI specialists know what to look for in the record? Are your coders clinical enough to understand where to find information in the operative report?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThis is not by any means an all-inclusive list of things to worry about. With six months left, we need to take stock of where we are and prioritize our remaining tasks. And it’s also a good time to start planning your post-implementation success party so we can pat ourselves on the back for getting this major upgrade up and running.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;',

Peck Rachel’s feet.\r\n\r\nWe need the same information for foot punctures as we do for hand puncture wounds:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Which foot?</li>\r\n	<li>Any toes pecked (or ankles or legs)?</li>\r\n	<li>Any beaks left in the wound?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe know this is a first encounter, and the chicks pecked the top of both of Rachel’s feet without leaving any parts behind, so we’ll report:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S91.331A, puncture wound without foreign body, right foot, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S91.332A, puncture wound without foreign body, left foot, initial encounter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nNotice two things. First, we don’t have a bilateral code option, so we need to report two separate codes.\r\n\r\nSecond, the codes are in different categories. ICD-9-CM groups injuries by the type of injury. ICD-10-CM groups them by the site of the injury.\r\n\r\nWe could also add some external cause codes, including W61.33XA (pecked by chicken). External cause codes, like ICD-9-CM E codes, are not mandatory so check your state and payer rules.\r\n\r\nOnce Rachel and Amanda’s mom tended to their peep peck injuries, the girls decided to introduce the chicks to the family dog, Abe. Not a good idea. Abe looked at those little fuzz balls and considered them his own personal toys.\r\n\r\nThe peeps weren’t in the mood to play with a slobbering pooch and took off for parts unknown (okay, they scooted under the table where the dog couldn’t reach). Not to be deterred, Abe began running around the table looking for an opening and rudely shoving people out of their chairs in an effort to get under the table to his new “toys.”\r\n\r\nLittle Joey thought this new game was great and enthusiastically joined in. When Aunt Ruth attempted to rescue Joey, she instead tripped over a rug Abe had disturbed and went down in a heap. As a result of her fall, Ruth dislocated her left wrist.\r\n\r\nTo code her injury in ICD-10-CM, we need to know exactly what she dislocated. Was it the carpometacarpal joint, the distal radioulner joint, midcarpal joint, or the radiocarpal joint? Maybe it was a metacarpal bone (or many metacarpal bones).\r\n\r\nIf you look up <em>dislocation, wrist</em>, in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index, you are directed to look up the specific joint or bone under <em>dislocation</em>. You don’t even get a hint of a code.\r\n\r\nSay Ruth dislocated her left radiocarpal joint. We’re directed to S63.02-. The dash tells us we need more characters for our code. Unfortunately, not even code that needs more characters has a dash in the Alphabetic Index, but since we always look in the Tabular List anyway, we’ll find those extra characters.\r\n\r\nS63.02- includes options for right, left, and unspecified wrist (we know it’s the left) and separate codes for dislocations and subluxations. Don’t know the difference? Chat with another coder or clinical documentation improvement specialist.\r\n\r\nWhile Gary takes Ruth off to the Acme ED for treatment, I think I am going to treat myself to a bite of that nice chocolate bunny over there. I hope he doesn’t bite back!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;',

I am not trying to pick on physicians (really), but everything we do as coders depends on what the physician includes in the chart.\r\n\r\nWe know we can’t go back to a previous encounter and pick up details about a patient’s illness in ICD-9-CM. For example, the physician documents that a patient has Type 2 diabetes, is insulin-dependent, and suffers from peripheral neuropathy. On the next visit, the physician simply documents “diabetes.” We can’t look back at the previous note and add all of the additional detail.\r\n\r\nThe same will hold true in ICD-10-CM. No looking back in the record for information. We can only code what the physician documented for that particular encounter.\r\n\r\nWhy is that such a big deal in ICD-10-CM? Because of the increased specificity (obviously), but also because of the seventh character.\r\n\r\nCodes in chapters 19 (Injury, Poisoning, and Certain Other Consequences of External Causes) and 20 (External Causes of Morbidity) use seventh characters to denote the encounter. In most cases, ICD-10-CM gives us three choices for that seventh character:<!--more-->\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>A, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>D, subsequent encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S, sequela</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe seventh character will allow us to follow an injury through the entire course of treatment—provided the physician documents all of the information at each visit. However, if the physician leaves out details on the subsequent encounter, we may end up with a different code and not just a different seventh character.\r\n\r\nConsider this scenario: Allen comes into the ED after being involved in a car accident. He suffered multiple lacerations and in some cases, glass remained in the wounds. His injuries may include:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S41.121A, laceration with foreign body of right upper arm, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S51.021A, laceration with foreign body of right elbow, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S61.521A, laceration with foreign body of right wrist, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S61.011A, laceration without foreign body of right thumb without damage to nail, initial encounter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nForeign bodies remained in three of the four lacerations. Ideally when Allen comes in to see his primary care physician for a wound check, we would report the same four codes with seventh character D to indicate a subsequent encounter. (Unless Allen receives some active treatment for the injury. Then we’re back to seventh character A.)\r\n\r\nThe caveat is the physician has to document “with foreign body” for the subsequent encounter. Otherwise we would report codes “without foreign body.” We can’t go back to the ED record and see that glass remained in the wounds.\r\n\r\nDoes it really matter? Yes and no. Yes in the sense that we want to follow the injury all the way through treatment and healing mainly for data purposes. On the other hand, our payment won’t change and the treatment likely won’t change (unless some glass remains in the wound and causes problems).\r\n\r\nIs it worth a query? To me, no. We already know our query rates will go up in ICD-10, both for diagnoses and procedures. As much as we would like to code every single diagnosis and procedure to the absolute highest level of specificity possible, sometimes we have to settle. With or without foreign body on a subsequent encounter is not a big enough battle to fight, in my opinion.\r\n\r\nThis does provide one more thing to think about when you are reviewing your physician documentation prior to implementation. Don’t look just at the initial encounters. Make sure you are also looking at those follow-up visit charts.',

Finn is currently suffering from a fever, reduced appetite, and sore throat, according to his mom Melissa. Finn just developed painful sores near his mouth and a skin rash with flat red spots on the palms of his hands and soles of his feet. Melissa is worried that Finn caught some horrible disease at daycare.\r\n\r\nDr. Spock examines Finn and diagnoses hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD). Although it is highly contagious, HFMD is not usually life-threatening. In fact, most patients get better in seven to 10 days without treatment. HFMD is most commonly caused by a coxsackievirus.\r\n\r\nHow would we code little Finn’s visit? If we look up “hand, foot, and mouth disease” in the Alphabetic Index, we find an entry for “hand-foot syndrome,” which sends us to L27.1 (localized skin eruption due to drugs and medicaments taken internally). Clearly that is the wrong condition because Dr. Spock didn’t document any drugs being ingested.\r\n\r\nLet’s head back to the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index and try “Disease, diseased” as our main term. The index does contain an entry for hand, foot, and mouth—B08.4.\r\n\r\nWhen we go to the Tabular List to double-check our code, we notice that the code description is “enteroviral vesicular stomatitis with exanthema.” Fortunately, underneath that, we see “hand, foot, and mouth disease.”\r\n\r\n<!--more-->We know we have the correct code, but do we need any other codes? That depends on Dr. Spock’s documentation. If Dr. Spock identified the underlying cause of Finn’s HFMD, we could code that as well.\r\n\r\nFor example, if Dr. Spock documented “hand, foot, and mouth disease caused by a coxsackievirus,” we would report B97.11 (coxsackievirus as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere) as a secondary code. We don’t need to report this code and we would not query for it. If it’s in the documentation, we can report it.\r\n\r\nIf you look at “Bacterial and viral infectious agents (B95-B97)” in the Tabular List, you’ll find this note:\r\n\r\n<em>These categories are provided for use as supplementary or additional codes to identify the infectious agent(s) in diseases classified elsewhere.</em>\r\n\r\nSo it’s nice information to report if your physician documents it, but it’s not required. In some cases, the physician may not know the causative organism, so we can’t code one. And that’s okay. Physicians should not perform unnecessary lab tests just for additional specificity.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;',

They also make great fodder for this blog.\r\n\r\nI recently came across an article on <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/health/acting-out-dreams-is-often-early-sign-of-116327197707.html\">REM sleep behavior disorder</a> (RBD) and its link to later neurological diseases. If you suffer from RBD, you’re pretty much doomed to a disease like Parkinson’s if you live long enough. It’s also worth mentioning that if you live long enough, you’re almost assured of developing cataracts. Old age is not for wimps.\r\n\r\nWhat is RBD? It’s basically moving around during REM sleep (that really, really deep sleep when you’re not supposed to be able to move). It’s not the same as sleepwalking.\r\n\r\nDoctors think people with RBD have a brain-stem malfunction that allows them to move during REM sleep, and thus act out their dreams, according to a study published in <em>JAMA Neurology</em>.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->On the bright side, RBD affects about 0.5% (35 million) people worldwide. (More than 7 billion people call planet Earth home, in case you were wondering.)\r\n\r\nDoes ICD-10-CM include a code for RBD? Inquiring coding minds want to know. It’s not a particularly prevalent disease, but then again, neither is mad cow and it has three ICD-10-CM codes. You do need to look up mad cow disease by its correct medical name (Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease) to find the codes, but they do exist.\r\n\r\nBack to RBD. I started in the Alphabetic Index under disorder, sleep. I found a lot of sleep disorders, but nothing for REM sleep behavior. I also tried RBD and REM and struck out both times. Never fear, persistence pays off. In this case, I went back to disorder and looked for REM, or rapid eye movement.\r\n\r\nREM sleep behavior turns out to be the winning term under disorder. That leads to code G47.52 under parasomnia (G47.5).\r\n\r\nG47.5 features an Excludes1 note for:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Alcohol-induced parasomnia (F10.182, F10.282, F10.982)</li>\r\n	<li>Drug-induced parasomnia (F11.182, F11.282, F11.982, F13.182, F13.282, F13.982, F14.182,F14.282, F14.982, F15.182, F15.282, F15.982, F19.182, F19.282, F19.982)</li>\r\n	<li>Parasomnia not due to a substance or known physiological condition (F51.8)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIn ICD-10-CM, Excludes1 means the conditions are mutually exclusive. They cannot occur in the same patient at the same time. Make sure you’re checking those notes.\r\n\r\nI went one step further and looked into coding Parkinson’s disease in ICD-10-CM. Primary or idiopathic Parkinson’s has only one code—G20. Secondary Parkinson’s has eight. If you see a notable number of patients with Parkinson’s, take a look at the documentation. Does it tell you whether the Parkinson’s is primary or secondary for each encounter? Remember, you can’t go back to documentation from previous encounters. The provider needs to document it each time.\r\n\r\nIf the patient has secondary Parkinson’s, look for documentation of the specific type, such as:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Malignant neuroleptic syndrome</li>\r\n	<li>Neuroleptic induced parkinsonism</li>\r\n	<li>Vascular parkinsonism</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIf your physicians already document this information, great. If not, start asking for it now. Having it won’t hurt for ICD-9-CM and it may help train them for ICD-10-CM.',

He was on a real roll with those dice, racking up a 14-hour winning streak. However, on that last throw, something went very wrong. Steve flicked the dice with his patented curveball throw and felt something pop in his elbow. He suffered excruciating pain and could not throw the dice again.\r\n\r\nSo much for that winning streak. Steve went to a Las Vegas ED, where Dr. Siegfried diagnosed a torn right ulnar collateral ligament. There goes Steve’s pitching career.\r\n\r\nWhen we look up <em>torn</em> in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index, we are directed to <em>see Tear. </em>Okay, let’s go to Tear, ligament. And we’re sent elsewhere again, this time to <em>Sprain</em>. We’ve got it this time—<em>Sprain, ulna, collateral ligament. </em>But no, success eludes us once again. We need to <em>see Rupture, traumatic, ligament, ulnar collateral</em>.\r\n\r\nI think I’m spending more time looking for this code than Dr. Siegfried spent examining Steve. Under Rupture, traumatic, ligament, ulnar collateral, we find, S53.3-. The dash tells us we need more characters, so off to the Tabular List we go.\r\n\r\nWe need two pieces of information to complete our code: laterality and encounter. We know Steve tore his right ulnar collateral ligament and we know this is his first visit. That makes our code S53.31XA (traumatic rupture of right ulnar collateral ligament, initial encounter). Don’t forget your placeholder X.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->Astute coders that we are, we noticed the note under S53:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Excludes1: sprain of ulnar collateral ligament (S53.44-)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nExcludes1 notes are pure excludes notes. You can’t have both conditions together. Makes sense. If you’ve ruptured the ligament, you can’t also sprain it. A sprain is a mild tear.\r\n\r\nHowever, that does raise an interesting question. Did Steve completely tear his ulnar collateral ligament or did he just sprain it? (By the way, if you look up Sprain, elbow, ulnar collateral ligament, you’ll arrive at S53.441A.)\r\n\r\nTo find the answer, we go back to the documentation. In rereading Dr. Siegfried’s note, we see that she did document Steve’s injury as a traumatic rupture. S53.31XA it is.\r\n\r\nWe can also add some external cause codes, if we so desire:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Y93.89, activity, other specified (shooting craps does not have its own code. Maybe next year.)</li>\r\n	<li>Y92.59, other trade areas as the place of occurrence of the external cause (casino)</li>\r\n	<li>Y998, other external cause status (leisure activity)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBecause Steve’s injury is so severe, Dr. Siegfried recommends Steve see his own physician back in Anytown.\r\n\r\nSteve duly comes in to see Dr. Roy at the Fix ‘Em Up Clinic. Dr. Roy examines the injury and determines Steve needs Tommy John surgery. Dr. Roy does not provide any treatment at this visit, just evaluates the injury and refers Steve to an orthopedist for surgery. We would report S53.31XA for an initial encounter again because Steve\'s injury is not in the healing phase.',

I did not read all 1,526 page word for word, in part because of the number of tables included in the proposed rule.

What makes the discussion interesting this year is CMS refers mainly to ICD-10-CM and ICD-10-PCS codes. Last year, CMS used ICD-9-CM codes.

Dr. Jobe is set to perform the surgery today at the Stitch ‘Em Up Hospital.\r\n\r\nA side note before we go any further. Tommy John surgery is generally performed in the outpatient setting. It generally takes 60 to 90 minutes to complete. A patient who needs Tommy John surgery probably doesn’t meet the criteria for inpatient admission. Because the Stitch ‘Em Up Hospital likes to compare data between inpatient and outpatient procedures, our coders code all surgeries using ICD-10-PCS. We’re overachievers that way.\r\n\r\nOn to Steve’s procedure. Well, actually, let’s take a look at Steve’s diagnosis code for this visit. We need to show the medical necessity of the procedure before our payer will reimburse us.\r\n\r\nDr. Jobe documents a traumatic rupture of the right ulnar collateral ligament. When we look up Rupture, traumatic, ligament, ulnar collateral in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index, we are directed to S53.3-. Further investigation in the Tabular List leads us to S53.31XA.\r\n\r\nWe’re back to seventh character A because on this visit, Steve is receiving active treatment. Surgery is one of the examples <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/icd/ICD10cmguidelines_2015%209_26_2014.pdf\">the <em>ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting</em></a> cite as active treatment. If Dr. Jobe was just evaluating Steve’s elbow and not treating it, our seventh character would be D for subsequent encounter. In fact, the guidelines state:\r\n\r\n<em>While the patient may be seen by a new or different provider over the course of treatment for an injury, assignment of the 7<sup>th</sup> character is based on whether the patient is undergoing active treatment and not whether the provider is seeing the patient for the first time.</em><!--more-->\r\n\r\nNow that we have the diagnosis all squared away, we can move on to the procedure.\r\n\r\nIn the title of the operative report, Dr. Jobe calls the procedure Tommy John surgery. ICD-10-PCS does not include Tommy John as an index term. In fact, ICD-10-PCS has banished almost all eponyms from the manual. The only one I’ve found so far is Roux-en-Y.\r\n\r\nSo what is Dr. Jobe actually doing? A better medical name for Tommy John surgery is ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) reconstruction. Basically, Dr. Jobe will harvest a tendon from Steve’s forearm, drill two holes in his ulna and three in his medial epicondyle (the small bump of bone on the inside of the elbow at the end of the humerus), then thread the tendon through the holes.\r\n\r\nSurgeons commonly use the palmaris longus tendon for UCL repair because the tendon really doesn’t serve much of a purpose. In fact, not everyone has it.\r\n\r\nWe know we’re in the Medical and Surgical section, so our first character is 0 (the number zero). Next comes the body system. Dr. Jobe is working on the elbow joint, so you may be tempted to use Upper Joints as your body section. However, Dr. Jobe is really operating on the ligament, not the joint. That means our body section would be Bursae and Ligaments (M).\r\n\r\nNow the really fun part—determining the root operation. What is the intent of the procedure? To replace a torn ligament with a tendon.\r\n\r\nThat seems to fall under root operation Replacement (putting in or on biological or synthetic material that physically takes the place and/or function of all or a portion of a body part). Sadly, body section Bursae and Ligaments does not include a table for Replacement.\r\n\r\nNow what? Are we in the wrong body part or did we pick the wrong root operation? We guessed wrong on the root operation.\r\n\r\nReplacement is one of the six root operations that always requires a device. Dr. Jobe isn’t putting in a device as ICD-10-PCS defines it, so Replacement is out.\r\n\r\nMaybe it’s Supplement (putting in or on biological or synthetic material that physically reinforces and/or augments the function of a portion of a body part). We have a table for Supplement in the Bursae and Ligaments body system and we have a body part for right elbow bursae and ligament.\r\n\r\nLook carefully at the operative report and at the definition of Supplement. Dr. Jobe is not reinforcing the damaged ligament. He’s replacing it. Not a Supplement either.\r\n\r\nThe correct root operation is actually Repair (restoring, to the extent possible, a body part to its normal structure). Repair (third character Q) is the not-elsewhere-classified root operation. It’s kind of a catch-all for procedures that don’t really fit anywhere else.\r\n\r\nNow that we know we’re in table 0MQ, the rest of the code is pretty easy. We know Dr. Jobe is replacing a right elbow ligament, which makes the fourth character 3.\r\n\r\nThe table gives us three choices for an approach:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>0, open</li>\r\n	<li>3, percutaneous</li>\r\n	<li>4, percutaneous endoscopic</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIn a UCL reconstruction using a docking technique, the surgeon makes an incision in the inner part of the elbow, then splits the muscles and retracts them to visualize the bones. So this is an open procedure.\r\n\r\nWe can only choose ZZ for our final two characters (device and qualifier), so our final code is 0MQ30ZZ (repair right elbow bursa and ligament, open approach).\r\n\r\nBut wait, we’re not quite done yet. In ICD-10-PCS, we will report the tendon harvest using a separate code (guidelines B3.9).\r\n\r\nDr. Jobe is removing part of the palmaris longus tendon of Steve’s right forearm (luckily he has one).\r\n\r\nOur section remains Medical and Surgical, but our body system becomes Tendons (L). Since Dr. Jobe is not removing the entire tendon, we’re going to code an Excision (cutting out or off, without replacement, a portion of a body part).\r\n\r\nThat gives us table 0LB. The table includes a body part for a right lower arm and wrist tendon (5). This table gives us the same three approaches. Dr. Jobe again documents an open approach, so our fifth character is 0. Our sixth character is Z by default—Z is our only choice. However, the table gives us two choices for the seventh character:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>X, diagnostic</li>\r\n	<li>Z, no qualifier</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThis is an easy choice because we aren’t doing a diagnostic procedure. Our second code is 0LB50ZZ (excision of right lower arm and wrist tendon, open approach).\r\n\r\nDr. Jobe stiches Steve up and orders him to stay away from the craps table in the future.',

Today’s new fact: you can be a professional video game player. I’m not sure why that surprises me. After all, video games have come a long way from the Atari and Pong days (Or so I hear. I stopped playing video games around the time Pac-Man became passé).\r\n\r\nLike anyone who performs repetitive movements over and over, gamers can develop repetitive strain injuries (RSI). Gamers can develop Nintendo thumb where the base of the thumb meets the wrist.\r\n\r\nSadly, we do not have ICD-10-CM codes for Nintendo thumb or gamer\'s grip. I also doubt that you see physicians documenting Nintendo thumb.\r\n\r\nThis particular RSI can be a form of tendinitis, tenosynovitis, or a combination of both.\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM offers plenty of codes for those injuries. But what is the difference?\r\n\r\nTendonitis means inflammation of a tendon. The term tendonitis is usually used for tendon injuries that involve acute injuries accompanied by inflammation.\r\n\r\nTenosynovitis means inflammation of the sheath that surrounds a tendon. (The sheath is called the synovium.)\r\n\r\nPatients may also suffer from tendinosis (chronic degeneration of a tendon without inflammation) or tendinopathy (a more general term that just means tendon injury). Make sure you pay close attention to what the physician actually documents.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->The ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index entries for both tendinitis and tenosynovitis list plenty of anatomical locations, but they also include an entry for “due to use, overuse, and pressure.”\r\n\r\nFor those injuries, the index directs us to see Disorder, soft tissue, due to use, overuse, and pressure. Again, ICD-10-CM divides these codes into anatomical locations. In addition, it also separates codes between specified and unspecified.\r\n\r\nOf course, these codes also do specify laterality, but they do not have a bilateral option. If a patient has tendonitis in both the right and left thumbs, you’ll need to report two codes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>M70.841, other soft tissue disorders related to use, overuse and pressure, right hand</li>\r\n	<li>M70.842, other soft tissue disorders related to use, overuse and pressure, left hand</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nNotice that we do not have codes for the fingers (or the toes for that matter). We’re stuck with the general term hand.\r\n\r\nIf the physician does not specify what type of soft tissue disorder the patient has, we will use two different codes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>M70.941, unspecified soft tissue disorder related to use, overuse and pressure, right hand</li>\r\n	<li>M70.942, unspecified soft tissue disorder related to use, overuse and pressure, left hand</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nICD-10-CM is a little more in tune with gamer injuries than I am. In the external cause codes, you’ll find two game-playing activity codes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Y93.C1, activity, computer keyboarding</li>\r\n	<li>Y93.C2, activity, hand-held interactive electronic device</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nReporting external cause codes is not mandatory (unless the payer demands it), but they do help tell a better story about the patient’s condition.',

That’s a lot of sniffling and sneezing.\r\n\r\nWhat are all of these people allergic to? Just about everything:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Bee stings</li>\r\n	<li>Cat dander</li>\r\n	<li>Cockroaches</li>\r\n	<li>Dust</li>\r\n	<li>Grain</li>\r\n	<li>Grass</li>\r\n	<li>Peanuts</li>\r\n	<li>Pollen</li>\r\n	<li>Ragweed</li>\r\n	<li>Rose pollen</li>\r\n	<li>Shellfish</li>\r\n	<li>Wheat</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<!--more-->The list goes on and on.\r\n\r\nMost people are familiar with seasonal allergies. The flowers bloom and release pollen, and all of a sudden you can’t stop sneezing.\r\n\r\nWhen we code allergies in ICD-10-CM, we need to know the specific cause of the allergy. We also need to know the manifestation of the allergy. Finally, in some cases, we need to know how the patient came into contact with the allergen.\r\n\r\nJill just brought home a new puppy and her husband Jack has been sneezing ever since. Jack’s doctor diagnoses an allergic reaction to dog dander. When we look up Allergy, dander in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index, we see two terms in parentheses—animal and rhinitis.\r\n\r\nIn ICD-10-CM (as in ICD-9-CM before it), words in parentheses are considered nonessential modifiers. If the physician documents them, great, gold star for the doc. If the physician doesn’t document them, no harm, no foul. You can still assign the code. For the dog dander allergy, we would report J30.81 (allergic rhinitis due to animal [cat] [dog] hair and dander).\r\n\r\nAllergic rhinitis can be seasonal, meaning it only shows up at certain times of the year, or it may be perennial, meaning all year long. ICD-10-CM includes a code specifically for people with perennial allergies (J30.89, other allergic rhinitis).\r\n\r\nWhat happens if the physician doesn’t know what is causing the patient’s allergic rhinitis? No problem, we have a code for that: J30.9 (allergic rhinitis, unspecified).\r\n\r\n<em>But that’s an unspecified code, you say. We’re not supposed to use unspecified codes in ICD-10-CM. They’re bad!</em>\r\n\r\nFortunately, not all unspecified codes are evil. In some cases, they represent the best information we have about the patient’s condition. The <em>ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting</em> state:\r\n\r\n<em>While specific diagnosis codes should be reported when they are supported by the available medical record documentation and clinical knowledge of the patient’s health condition, there are instances when signs/symptoms or unspecified codes are the best choices for accurately reflecting the healthcare encounter. Each healthcare encounter should be coded to the level of certainty known for that encounter. </em>\r\n\r\nThe guidelines go on to state that a physician should not order an unnecessary medical test just so the coder can assign a more specific code.\r\n\r\n<em>Achoo!</em> Now where did that box of tissues go?',

Fortunately, medical science has come a long way since the Middle Ages, and we can now successfully treat plague.\r\n\r\nBecause of its relative rarity here in the U.S., doctors don’t always suspect plague. In fact, physicians initially diagnosed the dog owner with pneumonia due to Pseudomonas (J15.1) before correctly diagnosing the plague.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->Doctors also incorrectly diagnosed two of the three other patients, while the final patient actually self-medicated her way to health without being diagnosed with plague.\r\n\r\nThe ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index includes 13 entries for plague, but in actuality, we only have seven codes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>A20.0, bubonic plague</li>\r\n	<li>A20.1, cellulocutaneous plague</li>\r\n	<li>A20.2, pneumonic plague</li>\r\n	<li>A20.3, plague meningitis</li>\r\n	<li>A20.7, septicemic plague</li>\r\n	<li>A20.8, other forms of plague</li>\r\n	<li>A20.9, plague, unspecified</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe also see an Includes note in the Tabular List under A20 (plague):\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Includes: infection due to <em>Yersinia pestis</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\nDon’t know which strain of plague your patient has?

Seriously, how many ICD-10 surveys have you been asked to fill out in the past year alone?\r\n\r\nIt’s very easy to look at survey results and think things look really good or really bad, depending on the survey and what you want to see.\r\n\r\nTake the NueMD 2015 <a href=\"http://www.nuemd.com/icd-10/survey/2015\">Attitudes Towards ICD-10 survey</a>, for example. When I first saw the results, I freaked out a little. How could 25% of the 1,000 respondents not be familiar with the ICD-10 coding standards? Even worse, how could 15% not be familiar with the proposed timeline for implementation?\r\n\r\nWhen you look at who took the survey, things become somewhat clearer (and slightly less alarming). NeuMD surveyed small and medium-sized physician practices, but they didn’t just ask the physicians and coders.\r\n\r\nOf the 1,000 respondents, 43% were clinicians, 16% were office managers, and another 13% were administrators. Billers, both in-house and contracted, made up 15% of the respondents. Eight percent identified themselves as \"other.\" Coders are not specifically identified, so they are probably part of that category.\r\n\r\nIt makes sense that the non-clinicians would not be familiar with ICD-10 coding standards. They don’t need to know them. What percentage of clinicians are familiar with the coding standards or, more importantly, the documentation requirements? We don’t know. The survey results don’t tell us.\r\n\r\nWhen you see survey results, think critically about them, just like you would any documentation that you see. What do the results really mean? Whose views are reflected in the results? Are the results relevant to you?\r\n\r\nSurvey results can be a good way to evaluate where you are or how you compare to others. Just make sure you’re making meaningful comparisons.',

They have sent off the final shipment to San Antonio (and not a moment too soon!).\r\n\r\nMatt, who has been coordinating packing and shipping for the conference, fell afoul of some falling boxes in the warehouse. One of the boxes landed on his foot, squashing it flat. At least, that’s what Matt claimed. It turns out the box only crushed two toes. Still painful and not particularly pleasant, but not as bad as initially thought.\r\n\r\nOur crack staff of CDI specialists immediately pulled out their <em>ICD-10-CM Manuals</em> to check on what documentation they need to code Matt’s injury.\r\n\r\nWe know Matt suffered a crush injury, so we start in the Alphabetic Index under <em>crush, crushed, crushing</em>. Judging by the list of options, you can crush a lot of body parts. ICD-10-CM does include an entry for foot, but also includes a more specific entry for toe(s)—S97.1-.\r\n\r\nThe dash tells us we need more characters for our code and we can find one of them in the Alphabetic Index. ICD-10-CM divides the toes into the great toe and the lesser toe(s). Which ones did the box crush?\r\n\r\nSuper CDI specialist Cheryl (a former ED nurse) identifies the great toe and one lesser toe as the injured parties. That means we’ll report two codes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S97.11-, crushing injury of great toe</li>\r\n	<li>S97.12-, crushing injury of lesser toe(s)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<!--more-->Note that we don’t need to know which or even how many lesser toes are involved. The code description is toe(s)—one code for up to four crushed lesser toes.\r\n\r\nWhen we get to the Tabular List, we see that we also need laterality. Cheryl tells us both toes are on Matt’s right foot. The final bit of information we need is the encounter. Since the box just crushed Matt’s toes, this is an initial encounter. Our final two codes are:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S97.111A, crushing injury of right great toe, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S97.121A, crushing injury of right lesser toe(s), initial encounter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe can also report some external cause codes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>W20.8XXA, other cause of strike by thrown, projected, or falling object, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>Y92.59, other trade areas as the place of occurrence of the external cause</li>\r\n	<li>Y93.E6, activity, residential relocation (this is kind of a stretch, but they are moving to Texas for a week)Y99.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nMike immediately comes to Matt’s rescue, lifting the (very heavy) box off of Matt’s foot and straining his back in the process.\r\n\r\nPeerless CDI specialist Laurie immediately ascertains that Mike strained his lower back and cites S39.012A (strain of muscle, fascia and tendon of lower back, initial encounter) as the correct code.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Mary Ann stumbles upon the scene of the accident and stops so abruptly she spills her entire super grande latte all over herself. The latte was so hot Mary Ann actually suffered burns on her hand. But never fear, spectacular CDI specialist Sharme is on the scene to treat the burns and provide the following codes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>T23.191A, burn of first degree of multiple sites of right wrist and hand, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>T31.0, burns involving less than 10% of body surface</li>\r\n	<li>X10.0XXA, contact with hot drinks, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>Y92.59, other trade areas as the place of occurrence of the external cause</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSharme also points out that for burns we need to report the source, place, and intent of the burn (X00-X19, X75-X77,X96-X98, Y92).\r\n\r\nAll of these injuries make me glad I am not involved in the prep work for the conference!',

Rather, the bill would require CMS to conduct 18 months of end-to-end testing open to all providers to determine whether the fee-for-service claims processing system works with ICD-10.\r\n\r\nIt’s interesting to note that the bill only mentions fee-for-service payments—basically physician practices. Both inpatient and outpatient facilities are paid under a prospective payment system.\r\n\r\nDuring the transition period and any ensuing extensions, CMS could not deny reimbursement only because of the “use of an unspecified or inaccurate subcode,” according to the bill.\r\n\r\nThe AMA has previously pushed for a similar guarantee, but so far, CMS isn’t going for it.\r\n\r\nRep. Diane Black, R-Tennessee, introduced the bill, which currently has three co-sponsors. It is competing with <a href=\"https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/hr2126/text\">H.R. 2126</a>, introduced by Rep. Ted Poe, R-Texas. Poe’s bill, however, would kill ICD-10.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;',

Ted Poe, R-Texas, introduced H.R.2126 April 30 in another attempt to kill ICD-10. The bill is identical to the one he introduced April 24, 2013. H.R. 2126 is likely to die in committee, just as H.R. 2126 did two years ago.\r\n\r\nNot surprisingly, Steven Stack, MD, incoming president of the American Medical Association, supports Poe’s bill and also wishes for ICD-10’s demise. Stack is in favor of skipping ICD-10 all together and jumping right to ICD-11. So you want to wait another 10 or 15 years to replace a coding system that is out of room now? Yeah, that’s a good idea. Not.\r\n\r\nThe World Health Organization is currently planning to release the beta version of ICD-11 in 2017. Keep in mind that CMS has been modifying ICD-10 for 20 years or so. If we needed 20 years to modify ICD-10, why would we need less time to modify ICD-11?\r\n\r\nThe <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2iGUdHR9d4hTmxobTFhdTIwX1k/view?pli=1\">AMA sent Poe a letter</a> reiterating its same claims for why we should not move to ICD-10. The AMA <a href=\"http://library.constantcontact.com/download/get/file/1102805358610-338/ICD-10+Letter+to+Rep+Poe_1.pdfhttp:/www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/advocacy/federal/advocacy-with-congress.page?\">sent Poe a very similar letter</a> in 2013.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->In the 2015 letter, James L. Madara, MD, AMA’s executive vice-president and CEO, provides the same reasons for not moving to ICD-10:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>It will cost too much—That depends on who you ask. We’ve <a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/2014/11/what-will-the-icd-10-transition-really-cost/\">seen wide variances</a> in the estimates of transition costs. Also, many providers, including hospitals, clinics, and physician practices, have already spent millions (quite possibly billions) on ICD-10 implementation. If Congress kills ICD-10, will it reimburse those entities?</li>\r\n	<li>It has too many codes—Yes, ICD-10 includes way more codes than ICD-9-CM. The biggest reason for the increase is laterality. Is it right, left, bilateral, or unspecified? In some cases you go from one ICD-9-CM code to three ICD-10-CM codes. In other cases, you get four choices in ICD-10-CM. Really, physicians should be (and probably are) documenting laterality. So what’s the big deal? Oh, and by the way, ICD-9-CM does not have a code for Ebola. ICD-10-CM does.</li>\r\n	<li>The timing isn’t right—The AMA’s argument centers on all of the other burdens placed on physician practices. They have to implement electronic medical records and participate in quality measures. I’m not sure when the AMA believes physician practices will not be faced with other requirements and will have the money to spend on ICD-10 implementation. ICD-10 implementation isn’t new. If physician practices had planned ahead, they could have spread out the costs of implementation and taken their time making all of the changes.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIn the letter, Madara states: “As HIPAA-covered entities, physicians will be responsible for complying with this ICD-10 mandate, and therefore will bear the entire cost of such a transition.” I’m pretty sure that’s not true. In fact, if you listened to the testimony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee’s subcommittee on health’s ICD-10 Implementation in February, you know that’s not true.\r\n\r\nEdward M. Burke, MD, from the Beyer Medical Group in Missouri, told the subcommittee that his small practice (two physicians and three nurse practitioners) was already using ICD-10 and they had no problems making the switch. He also said they incurred no additional costs. Their software vendor handled all of the transition work.\r\n\r\nThe AMA’s arguments aren’t new and neither are the counterarguments. It’s time to stop the insanity and accept ICD-10 as a reality.',

Things did not start off swimmingly.\r\n\r\nPeerless CDI Laurie was out for a stroll along the Riverwalk when a very enthusiastic Great Dane decided to say hello, much to his owner (and Laurie’s) chagrin. The very Great Dane knocked Laurie into the San Antonio River. Unfortunately, a boat full of tourists was passing by just as Laurie took her tumble. The boat captain didn’t see Laurie and clipped her shoulder on the way by.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->Laurie suffered a contusion to the shoulder and a laceration on her forearm. Her fellow CDI specialists helped her out of the water and offered comfort, condolences, and some adult beverages to “calm her nerves.”\r\n\r\nBeing an intrepid CDI specialist (and a nurse to boot), Laurie quickly assessed her injuries, declared them minor, and headed straight for her ICD-10-CM Manual. She first looks up her laceration and notices she needs three pieces of information:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li> Which forearm</li>\r\n	<li>Foreign objects in the wound</li>\r\n	<li>Encounter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSince no pieces of the boat broke off, Laurie’s left forearm laceration contains no foreign bodies, so she jots down code S51.812A.\r\n\r\nShe’ll also need laterality and encounter for her shoulder contusion. Her injuries are again on the left side and this is an initial encounter, so she notes S40.012A as her shoulder contusion code.\r\n\r\nUndaunted by her dunking, peerless Laurie is prepared to educate her fellow CDI specialists using her near disaster as an example as the conference continues.',

Really, she loves it a little too much.\r\n\r\nShe decided to celebrate the end of her teaching duties at the<a href=\"http://www.hcpro.com/acdis/\"> Association of Clinical Documentation Improvement Specialists’</a> (ACDIS) annual conference with the super-duper-haven’t-eaten-in-two-months special at Lotsa Enchiladas Mexican Restaurant.\r\n\r\nShe awoke this morning with severe abdominal pain intensified by movement, nausea, and vomiting. At first, she wasn’t very concerned. She thought it was just the aftermath of a massive Mexican food binge. Then she noticed blood in her vomit and decided it was time to go to the hospital.\r\n\r\nDr. James diagnosed Cheryl with a nontraumatic stomach rupture. Her fellow CDI specialists Laurie and Sharme came to commiserate and wish her well. Then they headed back to the conference where they promptly searched the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index for a code for Cheryl’s malady.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->The index does indeed include a code for a ruptured stomach—K31.89. The index entry also includes the nonessential modifiers \"nontraumatic\" and \"spontaneous.\" Nonessential modifiers are terms that could be included in the documentation, but are not required for code assignment. If Cheryl’s stomach had resulted from a traumatic injury, we would report S36.39- with the appropriate seventh character.\r\n\r\nLaurie and Sharme check the Tabular List to make sure they have the correct code and learn that K31.39 is an “other” code, specifically “other diseases of the stomach and duodenum.”\r\n\r\nRemember that other and unspecified are not synonymous. Other means we have details about the illness or injury but not a specific enough code. Unspecified is when we don’t have enough documentation to assign a specific code.\r\n\r\nFortunately for Cheryl, the rupture is minor and she is already on the mend—and planning her next Mexican feast.',

		'body' : 'Clinical documentation improvement (CDI) specialists are a passionate group and they love <a href=\"http://www.hcpro.com/acdis/\">ACDIS</a> director Brian Murphy. They love him so much, in fact, that his appearance in the exhibit hall at the 2015 ACDIS conference in San Antonio this week caused a stampede.\r\n\r\nSpectacular CDI specialist Sharme was not quick enough to escape the oncoming masses and was trampled in the rush to Brian.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being passionate, CDI specialists are also polite and nurturing, so Sharme’s stay at the bottom of the stampede was relatively short. She did come out of it with some minor injuries, though.\r\n\r\nAt first, she was concerned that she might have a minor concussion, but Dr. Jon quickly ruled that out. Sharme only suffered a contusion on the back of her head. That bump wasn’t the only injury to her skull, however. She also suffered a 2-cm laceration behind her ear.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->Sharme did not sustain any broken bones, but she did end up with a nice puncture wound on her hand courtesy of someone’s very high heel. Sharme avoided any more serious injuries and instead has a collection of bruises more colorful than a Texas sunset.\r\n\r\nBecause she is surrounded by CDI specialists, Sharme decided to appropriate an <em>ICD-10-CM Manual</em> and thrill her audience of assistants with a recitation of the codes for her wounds.\r\n\r\nFor the contusion to the head, we need to know the exact location. Contenders include:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Scalp</li>\r\n	<li>Eyelid and periocular area</li>\r\n	<li>Nose</li>\r\n	<li>Ear</li>\r\n	<li>Lip and oral cavity</li>\r\n	<li>Other parts of the head</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSharme ended up with a bump on the back of her head, so we’ll go with S00.83XA (contusion of other part of head, initial encounter).\r\n\r\nFor the laceration, we have the same options for location. Sharme’s wound falls under scalp, but we need some additional information before we code the injury. Does the wound contain any foreign bodies? Dr. Jon did not locate any, so our code is S01.01XA (laceration without foreign body of scalp, initial encounter).\r\n\r\nOn to the puncture wound. Without even looking in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index, we know we’ll need laterality. We’ll probably also need to know whether any foreign bodies remained in the puncture.\r\n\r\nSharme’s left hand bore the brunt of the heel, which left a small piece of itself behind, so we would report S61.442A (puncture wound with foreign body of left hand, initial encounter).\r\n\r\nWe would also report individual codes for all of Sharme’s other contusions.\r\n\r\nSharme shows just how super she is, though, by returning to her duties as a conference room moderator.',

It’s worth noting that “nervous breakdown” isn’t actually a medical term or a psychiatric disorder. It’s a colloquial term. So can we code a nervous breakdown in ICD-10-CM?\r\n\r\nYou’re probably saying, well of course we can code it! The real question is what information do we need to code it?\r\n\r\nAs always, we’ll start in the Alphabetic Index. You won’t find anything applicable under nervous, although you do find:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Heart</li>\r\n	<li>Stomach</li>\r\n	<li>Tension</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<!--more-->In parentheses next to nervous, we have a note to <em>see also condition</em>. So let’s try <em>breakdown</em>.\r\n\r\nJudging by the list, we can code a lot of breakdowns in ICD-10-CM.

Summer, especially this summer, is no time to stop your ICD-10 education. We have 125 days left until ICD-10 implementation, so we need to fine-tune our coding and documentation. We also need to update queries and educate physicians.\r\n\r\nLet’s start with the easiest piece—ICD-10-CM coding. You probably think I am suffering from F22 (I’m not telling you what that is. You have to look it up.).\r\n\r\nSummer is primetime for outdoor injuries and ICD-10-CM includes plenty of specificity for reporting sprains, strains, fractures, allergic reactions to bug bites, and so on and so forth.\r\n\r\nCoding sunburns in ICD-10-CM is pretty easy. We just need to know the degree:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>0, sunburn of first degree</li>\r\n	<li>1, sunburn of second degree</li>\r\n	<li>2, sunburn of third degree</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<!--more-->No location, no encounter, just the degree. If the physician doesn’t specify, we do have an unspecified code available (L55.9). We don’t know how payers will handle unspecified codes, but they are available.\r\n\r\nOther summer conditions require additional details. For example, say a patient came in after being bitten by fire ants. If we wanted to code the bites, we need to know where they are. For example, we could have a nonvenomous insect bite of the:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Right wrist (S60.861-)</li>\r\n	<li>Lower back and pelvis (S30.860-)</li>\r\n	<li>Abdominal wall (S30.861-)</li>\r\n	<li>Left shoulder (S40.262-)</li>\r\n	<li>Right upper arm (S40.861-)</li>\r\n	<li>Left ankle (S90.562-)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWow, those fire ants were hungry.\r\n\r\nMany of the codes require laterality, but they all require a seventh character for the encounter.\r\n\r\nYou will see plenty of other injuries and illnesses over the summer (sunstroke, food poisoning, poison ivy), so you need to know how to code these (and other) conditions in ICD-10-CM.\r\n\r\nWe have a great way to help.

For example, I thought most physicians already documented laterality. To me, that’s a no-brainer. You should be documenting which side an injury is on. However, in talking with two CDI specialists from one facility, I found out that’s not always the case. When they conducted documentation audits for ICD-10-CM, they found that laterality was the most common piece of information missing. I was absolutely floored.\r\n\r\nYou can also pick up some good ideas just by chatting with your peers. During the ACDIS conference, Cheree A. Lueck, RN, BSN, and Megan Buyrn, RN, shared flip cards their team created for each surgical specialty to help capture all of the information coders need to code in ICD-10-PCS. Session attendees couldn’t wait to get an up-close look at the cards and many were talking about how to create something similar at their facilities.\r\n\r\nThe transition to ICD-10 is a huge undertaking and we have 117 days to prepare.

The Oklahoma delegation reportedly brought a resolution calling for physicians nationwide to simply boycott ICD-10, a proposal so outlandish and dangerous that the House of Delegates didn\'t even allow it to be debated or discussed for fear of legal action from the Federal Trade Commission.\r\n\r\nThe group finally found consensus on a resolution for the Delegation to vote this week regarding a two-year grace period during which providers cannot be penalized for mistakes in ICD-10 code reporting. William Jefferson Terry, MD, proposed the resolution.\r\n\r\nYou might remember Terry, a representative of the American Urological Association (AUA), <a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/2015/02/costs-transition-plan-focus-of-house-hearing-on-icd-10/\">as the only voice of dissent</a> among witnesses during February\'s House of Representatives hearing on ICD-10. He memorably complained that ICD-10 was too confusing and too extensive for physicians to ever adapt to—until another witness pointed out that the AUA had lobbied for 200 new codes for its specialty in the first ICD-10 update.\r\n\r\nTerry\'s resolution goes so far as to ask the AMA to find a way for physicians to opt out of contracts with Medicare and all other payers after implementation if they cannot figure out the codes, <em>MedPage Today</em> reports.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->This idea of a two-year grace period didn\'t just come from Terry\'s mind—it\'s clearly another part of a concerted effort with Republican congressmen to kill ICD-10. Last week, before Terry\'s proposal was made, Rep. Gary Palmer, a Republican from Terry\'s home state of Alabama, introduced <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2652/text\">H.R. 2652</a>, the Protecting Patients and Physicians Against Coding Act of 2015.\r\n\r\nThe bill calls for a two-year grace period during which providers submitting claims with ICD-10 codes \"are not penalized for errors, mistakes, and malfunctions relating to the transition.\" In other words, forget about laterality, tracking episodes of care, or any other specificity you\'ve spent years learning.\r\n\r\nIf it weren\'t so dismissive to all the coders, providers, and health system that have spent so much time and money learning ICD-10 in order to prepare for the government\'s mandate, this bill would almost be comical. By not holding providers accountable for ICD-10 codes, the government opens itself up to a Wild West atmosphere in which claims have no bearing on the actual treatment offered at best and massive fraud at worst.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Office of Management and Budget, <a href=\"https://paymentaccuracy.gov/high-priority-programs\">Medicare accounts for nearly $46</a> billion in annual improper payments today—that number would undoubtedly skyrocket if CMS did not require accurate diagnosis codes.\r\n\r\nThe bill also calls for the government to aid physicians with learning ICD-10 and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to study whether such efforts were effective. No, that\'s not déjà vu you\'re experiencing, this is the <a href=\"http://www.hcpro.com/PPM-313475-12342/GAO-reports-on-CMS-ICD10-preparations.html\">same exact study the GAO already completed</a> and reported to Congress earlier this year.\r\n\r\nThat study found <a href=\"http://www.roadto10.org/\">CMS\' extensive efforts</a> to educate providers to be adequate and encouraged testing efforts, such as the two successful <a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/2015/06/cms-second-end-to-end-testing-week-a-success/\">recent rounds of end-to-end testing.</a> The study also cited stakeholders who noted that delay efforts, largely led by the AMA, have been very damaging and costly to the industry.\r\n\r\nFinally, the bill calls for the GAO to study the effect of ICD-10 on the industry and report back no later than April 1, 2016. That\'s right, in less than six months during which ICD-10 codes do not matter at all, Palmer expects a study to decisively determine their impact on providers.\r\n\r\nIf this all sounds crazy to you—coders who have spent years learning ICD-10 and ready for the transition—it should. It\'s an obviously desperate ploy for the AMA to appeal to its members and congressmen to justify the massive donations they get from the healthcare industry. Would it surprise you to learn <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/races/summary.php?cycle=2014&amp;id=AL06\">a medical society was the largest outside donor</a>, by far, to Palmer\'s recent campaign?\r\n\r\nSo does this mean it\'s time to forget everything you\'ve learned and just prepare to just apply approximate ICD-10 codes for the next two years? I don\'t think so. Despite having 35 cosponsors—all Republican—Palmer\'s bill is competing with <a href=\"http://www.hcpro.com/HIM-316392-859/The-inevitability-of-ICD10-is-slowly-dawning-on-Congress.html\">two other ICD-10 bills.</a> Even if all of the representatives who introduced those bills joined forces, it\'d still be a very partisan uphill battle to get an individual bill through Congress. With the <a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/2015/04/good-news-from-congress/\">Sustainable Growth Rate out of the way</a>, Congress doesn\'t have any other major healthcare bills to attach these to.\r\n\r\nWhat Terry, the AMA, and Congress seem to forget is that the industry has had plenty of time (six years, to be exact) to prepare for this transition. These bills and debates only let providers think they can push off efforts and <a href=\"http://www.hcpro.com/HIM-315134-859/Providers-greatest-obstacle-to-ICD10-preparations-could-soon-be-removed.html\">do more damage than good</a>. Congress doesn\'t need to protect patients and physicians against codes—they just need to get out of the way.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;',

It also passed a resolution calling for a two-year grace period for physician coding (more on that in another post).\r\n\r\nCurrently four Cooperating Parties develop the ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM/PCS Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting as well as the American Hospital Association (AHA) <em>Coding Clinic for ICD-9-CM</em> and AHA <em>Coding Clinic for ICD-10-CM/PCS</em>. The current Cooperating Parties are:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>AHA</li>\r\n	<li>AHIMA</li>\r\n	<li>CMS</li>\r\n	<li>National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe four current Cooperating Parties “only allow certain physician groups and individuals to serve as ‘advisors’ on ICD-9-CM or ICD-10-CM,” according to the AMA’s resolution.\r\n\r\nThe resolution also states that the Cooperating Parties deliberate and make final decisions as to how ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM is constructed and interpreted “in secret without direct physician input and control influencing the final decisions and without the publication of minutes outlining their reasoning, perpetuating the gaps between the provider and the coder.”\r\n\r\n<!--more-->The AMA House of Delegates specifically resolved to advocate for inclusion as the fifth Cooperating Party with equal power in the planning, interpretation, and deployment of ICD-9-CM, ICD-10-CM, and future ICD systems.\r\n\r\nNotice the AMA does not mention ICD-10-PCS. Not surprising since physician practices will still use the AMA’s CPT® codes to report procedures.\r\n\r\nShould AMA get a seat at the table? Sure, why not? Why doesn’t AMA already have a voice? Getting the physician perspective can only help since the physicians are the ones who actually see the patients and document in the medical record. ICD-10-CM is supposed to use more clinical language than ICD-9-CM to better align with the way physicians practice medicine and the terminology they use. Hence the revision of asthma code descriptions to specify:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Mild intermittent</li>\r\n	<li>Mild persistent</li>\r\n	<li>Moderate persistent</li>\r\n	<li>Severe persistent</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nI’ve heard from some pulmonologists and coders that physicians don’t actually use those classifications. If we had physician representation among the Cooperating Parties, maybe we could eliminate some of the disconnect between physician-speak and coder-speak. That would make life easier on all of us.\r\n\r\nDon’t get me wrong. I totally disagree with the AMA’s attempts to kill ICD-10, but as the largest physician group, the AMA still has a right to be heard. AMA members could bring legitimate concerns to the attention of the other Cooperating Parties. They could hash out their differences (in a less public forum than Congress and <em>The New York Times</em>) and come to a democratic decision. Majority rules. The AMA might not like the outcome, but at least its members would have a chance to influence the decision proactively.\r\n\r\nAdding the AMA to the Cooperating Parties isn’t a new idea. James S. Kennedy, MD, CCS, CDIP, president of <a href=\"http://www.cdimd.com/\">CDIMD – Physician Champions</a> in Smyrna, Tennessee, wrote a fantastic article for our sister publication, <a href=\"http://www.hcpro.com/publication-newsletter-140-department-health-information-management.html\"><strong>Medical Records Briefing</strong></a>, about ICD-10 implementation in the December 2014 issue.

In and of itself, the resolution means very little. States cannot override the federal government, so Alabama can’t opt out of ICD-10. If a majority of states pass similar resolutions, though, that could catch Congress’ attention.<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/question-marks.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright  wp-image-3095\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/question-marks-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"question marks\" width=\"157\" height=\"157\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe resolution follows a disturbing trend. The American Medical Association (AMA) has been very vocal this week renewing its opposition to ICD-10. The House of Delegates voted to request a two-year grace period on ICD-10 codes that would allow physician practices to be paid even if they make coding errors. The AMA also resolved to explain how to break payer contracts and move to a cash-only practice.\r\n\r\nAlabama’s state medical association posted a blog entry encouraging a delay in ICD-10 implementation. In the post, the medical association again raises the specter of more codes and what a burden those additional codes will be.\r\n\r\nGuess what? No physician or coder is ever going to use all 68,000-plus ICD-10-CM codes. Not gonna happen. So who cares that ICD-10-CM has four times as many codes as ICD-9-CM?\r\n\r\nWilliams Jefferson Terry, M.D., a Mobile, Alabama urologist who spoke during the House Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee in February, for one.<!--more-->\r\n\r\n\"The vast majority of America\'s physicians in private practice are not prepared,\" Terry told the subcommittee. Whose fault is that? ICD-10 didn’t sneak up on anyone. We’ve had six years to prepare. If you aren’t ready, shame on you. Some facilities and providers did slow down their implementation plans because of the repeated delays and the continuing calls for delay by the AMA.\r\n\r\n“Physicians widely agree the conversion to the new coding system will not improve patient care,” according to medical association’s blog post. Which physicians are they asking? And what do they consider wide agreement?\r\n\r\nDuring that same House subcommittee hearing, John Hughes, MD, professor of medicine at Yale University, admitted that physicians and patients will not see an immediate benefit from ICD-10-CM. However, the cumulative data would benefit patients down the line.\r\n\r\nIf the data is specific enough, researchers and physicians could track new procedures and new diseases and figure out what works and what doesn\'t, Hughes added.\r\n\r\n“Transitioning to ICD-10 requires an abundance of costly and time-consuming education for physicians and staff, software, coder training, and equipment testing,” the Alabama medical association claims in the blog.\r\n\r\nYes, ICD-10 will cost money to implement. Quite a bit of money has already been spent. Hospitals, payers, and proactive physicians have already spent billions preparing for ICD-10 implementation. CMS has conducted two successful end-to-end testing weeks with a variety of providers.\r\n\r\nAnd here’s the best part. Not all physician practices will need to shell out big bucks for ICD-10. \"We did not have special training,\" Edward M. Burke, MD, of the Beyer Medical Group in Missouri, told the House subcommittee in February. \"We did not spend ANY money in preparation. We did not see less patients, and our practice did not suffer. As providers, it was not frustrating or scary. It just was.\"\r\n\r\nThe continued attempts by the AMA to kill ICD-10 are frustrating. Enough is enough already.',

Gary Palmer, R-Alabama, <a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/2015/06/latest-icd-10-bill-shows-ama-congress-flailing-to-find-a-way-out-of-implementation/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+icd-10watch+%28ICD-10+Trainer%29\">doesn\'t want providers penalized</a> for ICD-10 \"errors, mistakes, and malfunctions relating to the transition\" for two years after implementation. Unfortunately, it doesn\'t appear the congressman considered the staggering implications of such a policy.</p>\r\nIt was obvious during <a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/2015/02/costs-transition-plan-focus-of-house-hearing-on-icd-10/\">Congress\' February subcommittee hearing on ICD-10</a> that most politicians involved didn\'t have anything but a cursory understanding of coding, billing, and reimbursement beyond the talking points they were working off.\r\n\r\nIn the months since, several Congressmen have demonstrated they weren\'t listening to the overwhelming support for ICD-10 from the gathered witnesses, with <a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/2015/05/if-at-first-you-dont-succeed/\">successively</a> <a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/2015/05/another-icd-10-bill-hits-congress/\">unrealistic</a> bills introduced. Palmer\'s bill stands alone, however, with the ability to not only remove any incentive for providers to learn ICD-10, but also increase the potential for fraud.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->CMS has already started to update the <a href=\"http://www.cms.gov/Outreach-and-Education/Medicare-Learning-Network-MLN/MLNMattersArticles/Downloads/MM9087.pdf\">National Coverage Determinations (NCD) for ICD-10.</a> NCDs provide information about which diagnoses need to be reported along with procedures in order to justify their use.\r\n\r\nFor example, Medicare will only pay for CPT<sup>®</sup> code 38240 (hematopoietic progenitor cell; allogeneic transplantation per donor) if ICD-10-CM code Z00.6 (encounter for examination for normal comparison and control in clinical research program) is reported along with one of the following codes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>D46.9, myelodysplastic syndrome, unspecified</li>\r\n	<li>D46.Z, other myelodysplastic syndromes</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThis is because the procedure is only covered as part of a Medicare-approved research study. Let\'s assume Palmer\'s bill passes and we now have a two-year grace period during which payers cannot deny a claim due to any ICD-10 errors.\r\n\r\nA patient is in an approved study and receives the transplantation described by 38240 and the coder reports Z00.6 and accidentally reports D46.0 (refractory anemia without ring sideroblasts, so stated). The procedure would be paid, but the patient would have an incorrect diagnosis in his or her record.\r\n\r\nIf CMS can\'t deny payments due to ICD-10 errors, CMS has no way to tell whether the coding is accurate without requesting and looking at the documentation for every claim.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nFor example, maybe the coder means to report E11.9 (unspecified diabetes), but accidentally codes E11.60 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with other specified complication). Now the patient\'s record shows a more serious type of diabetes and the claim would lead to a higher payment. This could be a simple mistake from a coder learning the new system, but it has clinical implications for the patient and payment implications for the provider.\r\n\r\nCould these types of errors be prevented by encoders and system edits warning coders and billers? Potentially, but Palmer\'s bill is even more problematic because it doesn\'t solve the fundamental potential issue with ICD-10: documentation.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/2014/08/deal-with-documentation-deficiencies/\">Provider documentation is already a problem</a> with the codes we have. The <a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/documents/2082397/2015-may-13-poe-letter-of-support-hr-2126.pdf\">American Medical Association claims that physicians simply don\'t have the time</a> to learn ICD-10 codes and their documentation requirements in addition to all of their other responsibilities.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/2013/11/ama-and-its-quest-for-icd-10-delay/\">Previous delays have killed the momentum for providers</a> to learn about potential documentation changes for ICD-10 already. Palmer\'s bill would go even further, by allowing coders to report ICD-10 codes with no oversight of their use. Does the bill take into account medical necessity? Does it prevent auditors from looking at these claims in the future? This not only impacts payers who could be responsible for paying claims with no medical justification, it will also directly impact patient care.\r\n\r\nFor example, ICD-10 contains the ability to track the healing process of injuries such as fractures through seventh characters. If providers do not need to document this level of detail (and coders do not need to accurately report it), all of that information will be left by the wayside. Without an incentive to improve documentation, providers won\'t do it by themselves.\r\n\r\nDuring the February hearing, politicians bemoaned the lack of impact ICD-10 would have for patients on day one of implementation. If we push off the requirement to track diagnoses and collect more specific information for two years, we\'re only delaying benefits for researchers and, ultimately, patients.\r\n\r\nPalmer also demonstrates his misunderstanding of how coding works, or is intentionally trying to undermine ICD-10by requiring the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to perform a study on the code set\'s impact on physicians by April 1, 2016.\r\n\r\nOf course, if providers are not accountable for any errors in ICD-10 coding, the first few months after implementation will be chaos. There could be many examples of documentation not matching coding whatsoever, leading the GAO to inevitably conclude that providers can\'t learn the new system. It\'s a conclusion all but guaranteed by a grace period that doesn\'t require any sort of accuracy. Even without the possibility of a few irresponsible providers taking advantage of the system, coding errors will simply happen regardless (as they do today), without an incentive to ensure they\'re correct. The GAO report would give Congress the ammo it needs to permanently kill ICD-10.\r\n\r\nCongress has tried to rein in healthcare costs for decades, but this shortsighted bill would end up doing the complete opposite, while stopping any incentive for providers to prepare for ICD-10.',

Okay, most of the time, I have no idea what the people at the AMA are thinking. Take the organization’s continuing crusade to kill ICD-10.\r\n\r\nDuring its House of Delegates meeting Tuesday, the AMA approved a resolution asking for a two-year grace period for ICD-10 coding, so that physicians would not be penalized for “errors, mistakes, and/or malfunctions of the system.”\r\n\r\nThe resolution further instructed the AMA to educate members about ways to cancel payer contracts and move to a cash-only practice. The problems associated with that plan are staggering. Yet the AMA resolved to aggressively promote this cash-only option to “protect patients’ access to care and physicians’ practices.”\r\n\r\nI’m not sure how going to a cash-only practice protects patients’ access to care.\r\n\r\nMy parents live in rural Western Pennsylvania. We don’t even have a stop light in my hometown, that’s how rural we are. The nearest healthcare providers are 10-15 miles away. Like most retired folks, my parents are on a fixed income. They have Medicare as well as another insurance plan. Some of Dad’s medical care is provided free by the Veterans Administration, but he does have a primary care provider in private practice that he sees as well.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\nLuckily Dad’s pretty healthy. He has one age-related problem (that I won’t specify because of HIPAA), but it doesn’t require significant treatment. He takes literally one pill a day. That’s it.\r\n\r\nMom’s a different story. She’s had some pretty significant health problems, starting with a hemorrhagic stroke in her 30s. She takes quite a few medications and sees two or three specialists regularly in addition to her primary care physician.\r\n\r\nWhat does this have to do with the AMA’s resolution? If the physicians my parents see decided to stop accepting insurance and go to a cash-only office, my parents can’t afford healthcare. They don’t have the money to pay for a full office visit out of pocket.\r\n\r\nA lot of other people are in the same boat. They can’t pay for office visits without insurance. If patients can’t afford to see a doctor, what’s going to happen to all of those cash-only practices? The same thing that will happen to them if they aren’t ready for ICD-10—no cash flow. No cash flow, no business.\r\n\r\nDoes that really help the patients and the physicians? Absolutely not. Does it help the AMA? No, unless the AMA is trying to represent fewer physicians. Does it help healthcare as an industry? Not in the least. Will it protect patients’ access to care? Doubtful, since most people won’t be able to afford care and as a result, practices will shut down, further exacerbating the physician shortage. So why is the AMA suggesting this new plan in the first place?\r\n\r\nIf the AMA is serious about protecting patients and improving the practice of medicine, it should embrace ICD-10. Yes, it costs money to make the transition. Yes, things will go wrong. Physicians will need to improve their documentation.\r\n\r\nImproving documentation doesn’t mean they need to compose <em>War and Peace</em> in their progress notes. They just need to add certain specific details. Is that gangrene linked to the patient’s diabetes? Tell us that. Is the patient’s hypertension related to his or her heart disease? Indicate that. Does the patient have osteoarthritis in one location or is it widespread? Just add a couple of words.\r\n\r\nIncomplete documentation isn’t a new problem, by the way, nor is it an ICD-10 specific problem. Coders and CDI specialists have been working to improve physician documentation for years, but changing behavior is hard. That’s why almost every coder in the United States knows 250.00 is the code for diabetes.\r\n\r\nCash-only practices aren’t the answer. Boycotting ICD-10 is not going to work. The AMA needs to stop dragging its feet and dreaming up ways to avoid ICD-10. Instead it should direct its energies to finding legitimate, workable ways to mitigate disruptions caused by the move to ICD-10. Otherwise, the AMA is hurting everyone—physicians, facilities, and, most importantly, patients.',

The birds, however, were in no mood to be watched.\r\n\r\nMary first came upon a warbler nest with four (almost) cute baby birds. While she was oohing and ahhing over the babies, momma warbler returned (or maybe it was daddy warbler) and attacked. Warblers aren’t very big birds, but they can pack a wallop when they start pecking you.\r\n\r\nMary suffered multiple puncture wounds from the bird’s beak. To code Mary’s puncture wounds, we need to know where they are. ICD-10-CM breaks injuries down by the body area, not the type of injury like ICD-9-CM.\r\n\r\nFor Mary’s bird attack, we could use the following codes (depending on our physician’s documentation):\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>S01.342A, puncture wound with foreign body of left ear, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S51.031A, puncture wound without foreign body of right elbow, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S61.032A, puncture wound without foreign body of left thumb without damage to nail, initial encounter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<!--more-->And so on, until we code all of her injuries. You no doubt noticed that all of the codes include certain information:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Laterality</li>\r\n	<li>Foreign body in wound</li>\r\n	<li>Encounter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nMake sure the physician is documenting this information.\r\n\r\nWe can also add some (non-mandatory) External Cause codes to provide a better picture of how and where Mary was injured:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>W61.91XA, bitten by other birds, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>Y92.821, forest as the place of occurrence of the external cause</li>\r\n	<li>Y99.8, other external cause status (leisure activity)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nICD-10-CM doesn’t (yet) include a code for bird watching. Maybe next year.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->Mary decides she’s had enough of the great outdoors and starts back up the path, only to encounter a flock of wild turkeys. The turkeys charge and Mary, deciding that discretion is the better part of valor, flees rather than confront the angry birds.\r\n\r\nFour hours later, she begins experiencing chills, fever, breathlessness, non-productive cough, and chest discomfort, so she heads into the Fix ‘Em Up Clinic.\r\n\r\nDr. Tweety examines her, orders a chest CT, and based on the results diagnoses bird fancier\'s lung. Um, Dr. Tweety, not to question your clinical judgment, but is that really a disease?\r\n\r\nBird fancier\'s lung is a type of hypersensitivity pneumonitis caused by the exposure to avian proteins present in the dry dust of the droppings and sometimes in the feathers of a variety of birds. Turkeys are one of the implicated birds.\r\n\r\nIf you don’t know that bird fancier\'s lung is a type of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, you can still code it in ICD-10-CM. If you look up “bird” in the Alphabetic Index, you find two conditions:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Face, Q75.8</li>\r\n	<li>Fancier\'s disease or lung, J67.2</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIf you try looking up lung, bird fancier’s, you won’t find it. You will find it listed under “disease.” When you go to the Tabular List, you’ll find bird fancier’s lung sandwiched between bagassosis and suberosis (corkhandler\'s disease).\r\n\r\nHmm, this is making me really paranoid about what I am breathing.

What exactly constitutes an “error” or a “mistake”? Is it something as simple as reporting H65.01 (acute serous otitis media, right ear) when you should have reported H65.02 (acute serous otitis media, left ear)? I can see that happening. I can also see a lot of coders reporting H65.00 (acute serous otitis media, unspecified ear).\r\n\r\nIncorrect or unspecified laterality is a simple mistake, probably caused by lack of familiarity with the codes or a lack of documentation. The payment isn’t going to change, so you may think of it as “no harm, no foul.” And you would be right, to a point. A problem could arise when the patient comes in for a follow-up visit and the physician is checking the wrong ear. The patient may remember and correct the physician or maybe not.\r\n\r\nNot all errors or mistakes are so minor. Consider what happens when you report I13.2 instead of I31.2.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->The patient goes from a diagnosis of hemopericardium, not elsewhere classified (I31.2) to a diagnosis of hypertensive heart and chronic kidney disease with heart failure and with stage 5 chronic kidney disease, or end-stage renal disease (I13.2). Very different conditions with very different clinical pictures and different treatment.\r\n\r\nIf the AMA had its way, presumably, the physician would still be paid, but we don’t know for which diagnosis. Would the physician receive payment for I13.2, the reported diagnosis, or I31.2, the correct diagnosis? The AMA doesn’t say.\r\n\r\nAnother thing to consider is the cause of the error or mistake. Did the coder simply select the wrong diagnosis code or transpose characters in the code?\r\n\r\nOr did the physician not document enough information, so the coder made a best guess rather than send a query?\r\n\r\nMaybe the physician was actually assigning the codes because he or she does not employ a coder or a coding service. In that case, the physician may have missed guidelines, sequencing rules, and additional codes. After all, the physician is trained to treat patients. The best solution to that problem is to hire a certified coder (or a reputable coding company).\r\n\r\nI’ve repeatedly heard the argument that small physician practices can’t afford to hire a coder. According to the <a href=\"http://www.justcoding.com/file/pdf/311550\">2014 JustCoding Salary Survey,</a> the largest percentage of coders earns $40,000-$49,999. Of course, part of that depends on the area. Coders in rural areas will make less than coders in big cities.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of hiring a professional coder can outweigh the investment in salary and benefits. For example, a certified coder may catch reportable diagnoses that the physician hasn’t been coding. Or the coder may improve reporting of modifiers, which helps reduce denials and speeds up reimbursement. The biggest benefit, though, is that the physician has more time to practice medicine.\r\n\r\nA two-year free ride isn’t the answer to helping physician practices through the transition. All it does is encourage physicians to continue dragging their feet on ICD-10 implementation. The AMA isn’t helping physicians with its continued push to delay (either outright or through the safe harbor) ICD-10.\r\n\r\nPhysician practices or facilities, for that matter, that are still not ready have 99 days to prepare.

The answer might depend on the type and size of your organization.\r\n\r\nEighty-five percent of hospitals reported training staff on ICD-10, according to a <a href=\"https://www.ehidc.org/articles/408-2015-icd-10-survey-results-webinar\">recent eHealth initiative survey</a> of 271 providers, while only 41% of physician practices have completed that task.\r\n\r\nPractices are also less likely to offer additional training for coders to maintain their skills. The survey found that 74% of all organizations offer additional coding training. Hospitals (80%) are more likely to provide additional training compared to practices (58%).\r\n\r\nThe survey found that just over half (60%) of small hospitals with less than 100 beds offer additional training to coders.\r\n\r\nThis makes a certain amount of sense. Small practices and hospitals are less likely to have the time and resources to devote to training and continuing education. But that doesn\'t mean it\'s too late for them to prepare. <a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/2015/06/cms-releases-quick-start-guide-for-icd-10/\">CMS just released</a> a guide for organizations to get on track to implementation no matter what step they\'re on.\r\n\r\nThis lack of training could be a problem since smaller organizations are more likely to rely on in-house coders, the survey concluded. Small hospitals (15%) and practices (14%) were the least likely groups to be planning on hiring more coders after the transition.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->Smaller practices might have a different focus for the challenges they face in the countdown to ICD-10. According to the survey, the top challenge for all organizations is maintaining clinical workflow and productivity. However, for both practices and small hospitals, the second greatest challenge relates to vendor and partner readiness.

Even though it\'s not as complete as end-to-end testing, providers should take advantage of the opportunity to test their systems ahead of October 1.',

Dr. Guts sends Richard for a battery of tests and discovers Richard suffers from a Meckel\'s diverticulum.\r\n\r\nWhen we look up diverticulum, Meckel’s in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index, we find two nonessential modifiers with the entry:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Displaced</li>\r\n	<li>Hypertrophic</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nNonessential modifiers are supplementary words that may be present or absent in the statement of a disease or procedure without changing code assignment. It doesn’t matter if Dr. Guts includes the words “displaced” or “hypertrophic” in the diagnosis. We’re still reporting the same code (Q43.0).\r\n\r\nThe only time we would use a different code for Meckel’s diverticulum is if Dr. Guts states the diverticulum is malignant. In that case, the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index instructs us to “see Table of Neoplasms, small intestine, malignant.”\r\n\r\nYou probably noticed that our diagnosis code falls within the congenital malformations, deformations and chromosomal abnormalities chapter of ICD-10-CM. A Meckel\'s diverticulum is a pouch on the wall of the lower part of the intestine that is present at birth, making it congenital. Patients may not have symptoms until years later.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->Dr. Guts decides that Richard’s Meckel\'s diverticulum, and consequently a portion of his small intestine, need to come out.\r\n\r\nDr. Guts admits Richard to the Stitch ‘Em Up Hospital and performs a partial resection of Richard’s small intestine. That’s all Dr. Guts documents. In the ICD-9-CM Volume 3 world, that’s enough information to report procedure code 45.62 (other partial resection of small intestine).\r\n\r\nThis code includes three different procedures:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Duodenectomy</li>\r\n	<li>Ileectomy</li>\r\n	<li>Jejunectomy</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThat’s all fine and well in ICD-9-CM. Those procedure codes are pretty generic. We don’t need to know which part of the small intestine Dr. Guts removed or even how much.\r\n\r\nWe could be in trouble in ICD-10-PCS, though. ICD-10-PCS requires significantly more information and it does not include unspecified or nonspecific codes.\r\n\r\nOur first two characters will be pretty easy. We’re going to be in the Medical and Surgical section (first character 0) and Dr. Guts is working on the gastrointestinal system (second character D).\r\n\r\nNow things get tricky. We need to determine the root operation. We have two choices:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Excision (third character B)</li>\r\n	<li>Resection (third character T)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBoth involve cutting a body part out or off without replacement. The only difference is how much Dr. Guts removes. If Dr. Guts removes all of a body part, we use Resection. If she only removes part of the body part, we code Excision.\r\n\r\nYou may be thinking, so what? That’s easy. Dr. Guts isn’t going to take out the whole small intestine, so we’re coding an Excision.\r\n\r\nNot so fast. ICD-10-PCS assigns body part characters to more than just whole organs or joints. Sections of organs also get their own body part values. For example, ICD-10-PCS assigns three body part characters to the liver: one for the whole liver, one for the right lobe, and one for the left lobe.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, ICD-10-PCS assigns separate body part values to parts of the small intestine:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Small intestine (fourth character 8)</li>\r\n	<li>Duodenum (9)</li>\r\n	<li>Jejunum (A)</li>\r\n	<li>Ileum (B)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nNow we need more information from Dr. Guts. What part of the small intestine did she remove and did she take out all of that section?\r\n\r\nThose questions may not be easy to answer. Unfortunately, the real human body doesn’t come with nicely divided sections like the ones you see in anatomy textbooks and drawings. Dr. Guts may not know if she removed the entire ileum.\r\n\r\nHopefully, she can tell us where Richard’s Meckel\'s diverticulum is located and she can give us the intent of the procedure.\r\n\r\nIf her intention is to remove the entire jejunum, I would code Resection. If she plans only to remove part of the jejunum, I would code Excision. The <a href=\"http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/ICD10/2016-ICD-10-PCS-and-GEMs.html\"><em>ICD-10-PCS Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting</em></a> A11 tells us:\r\n\r\n<em>It is the coder’s responsibility to determine what the documentation in the medical record equates to in the PCS definitions.</em> <em>The physician is not expected to use the terms used in PCS code descriptions, nor is the coder required to query the physician when the correlation between the documentation and the defined PCS terms is clear.</em>\r\n\r\nThe guidelines go on to add this helpful example:\r\n\r\n<em>When the physician documents “partial resection” the coder can independently correlate “partial resection” to the root operation Excision without querying the physician for clarification.</em>\r\n\r\nOkay, so we can code a partial resection of the small intestine. As long as we know the approach, that is.\r\n\r\nHow is Dr. Guts getting to the Meckel\'s diverticulum? ICD-10-PCS table 0DB gives us five choices for an approach:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Open (fifth character 0)</li>\r\n	<li>Percutaneous (3)</li>\r\n	<li>Percutaneous endoscopic (4)</li>\r\n	<li>Via natural or artificial opening (7)</li>\r\n	<li>Via natural or artificial opening endoscopic (8)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIf you don’t know your approaches, I strongly recommend reviewing the definitions in ICD-10-PCS. Otherwise you may be spending a lot of time searching for words the surgeon didn’t document. As with the root operations, the surgeon doesn’t need to say “percutaneous endoscopic approach.”\r\n\r\nDr. Guts documented performing a laparoscopic excision of the Meckel\'s diverticulum. She also documented visualizing the field though an endoscope. That give use percutaneous endoscopic for our approach.\r\n\r\nIf we don’t know which part of the small intestine Dr. Guts removed, we would report ICD-10-PCS code 0DB84ZZ (Excision of small intestine, percutaneous endoscopic approach).\r\n\r\nThis brings up another question. Should we query Dr. Guts for more specificity on this case? Will it help us to know, for instance, that she really performed 0DTB4ZZ (Resection of ileum, percutaneous endoscopic approach)?\r\n\r\nSure, it’s great for reporting purposes and data gathering, but is it worth sending a query for this information?\r\n\r\nICD-10-PCS procedure code 0DB84Z maps to the following MS-DRGs:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>MS-DRG 329, major small and large bowel procedures with MCC</li>\r\n	<li>MS-DRG 330, major small and large bowel procedures with CC</li>\r\n	<li>MS-DRG 331, major small and large bowel procedures without CC/MCC</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nICD-10-PCS procedure code 0DTB4ZZ maps to those same three MS-DRGs. While we want to be as accurate as possible with our coding, we probably wouldn’t send a query in this case. The additional information isn’t going to change our reimbursement. Just as in ICD-9-CM, we’ll need to pick our battles in both ICD-10-CM and ICD-10-PCS.\r\n\r\nWith only 96 days left until ICD-10 implementation, you need to make sure you have that battle plan drawn up.',

Archeologists in Peru <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/kristinakillgrove/2015/06/23/evil-twin-ovarian-tumor-found-in-skeleton-from-16th-century-peru/\">recently uncovered the skeleton of a teenage girl</a> in a historic cemetery of the Chapel of the Divino Niño Serranito de Eten.\r\n\r\nBig deal, right? A skeleton in a cemetery. Well, this particular skeleton included something extra—83 strange bits of bone and 37 oddly shaped teeth in her abdominal cavity.\r\n\r\nThat’s not something you see every day. Archeologists believe the extra bones and teeth represent the remains of an ovarian teratoma, a usually benign tumor in the ovary that contains various tissues including hair, teeth, and bone.\r\n\r\nWhile this teratoma is really old, physicians still see these growths today. In fact, mature cystic teratomas <a href=\"http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/281850-overview#a6\">account for 10-20% of all ovarian neoplasms</a>. As a reminder, a neoplasm can be benign or malignant. By definition a neoplasm is new, abnormal growth of tissue.\r\n\r\nIf this girl came in to the Fix ‘Em Up Clinic, how would we code her condition?\r\n\r\n<!--more-->The first thing we need to know is whether the neoplasm is really benign or malignant.\r\n\r\nFor a benign ovarian teratoma, ICD-10-CM supplies three possible codes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>0, benign neoplasm of right ovary</li>\r\n	<li>1, benign neoplasm of left ovary</li>\r\n	<li>9, benign neoplasm of unspecified ovary</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nICD-10-CM also includes a note to use an additional code to identify any functional activity.\r\n\r\nWe also see a long list of conditions under an Excludes2 note. In ICD-10-CM, we have two types of Excludes notes to take the guesswork out of what the note means. This Excludes2 note tells you that the listed conditions are not part of D27.-, but a patient can have both conditions at the same time.\r\n\r\nIf the physician documents a teratoma of the right ovary and an ovarian retention cyst, we would report two codes.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the physician determined that the teratoma was malignant, we would report a code from the Table of Neoplasms (C56.-).\r\n\r\nThe archeologists also considered other possible explanations for this odd extra tissue.\r\n\r\nThey ruled out an ectopic pregnancy (O00.-) because of the number of teeth. Note that the codes for an ectopic pregnancy begin with a capital O, followed by two zeros, just in case ICD-10-CM wasn’t confusing enough.\r\n\r\nThe archeologists eliminated lithopedion (a dead fetal mass calcified in the abdomen) as well as <em>fetus in fetu</em> (a tumor that divides into identifiable, but parasitic elements). Unfortunately, the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index does not include either term. So we would report a not-elsewhere-specified code. We might need to talk to a clinical person, though, to find out which code is the closest. (Hint, hint, make friends with the clinical folks now.)',

That’s not the idea. (And really we don’t want them coding. That’s our job.) Instead, talk to them about what information they need to document so coders can build an ICD-10-PCS code.\r\n\r\nDuring your respectful, non-combative conversation, you will probably hear the surgeons say they don’t care about ICD-10-PCS.\r\n\r\nI completely understand why some surgeons don’t care about ICD-10-PCS. It’s hospital coding and they will still be paid based on CPT® codes. That doesn’t mean they get to opt out of ICD-10-PCS.\r\n\r\nGetting surgeons up to speed does not have to be a negative experience. Physicians are not evil and they are not the enemy. Most of them want to do the right thing and at the same time provide the best possible quality care for their patients.\r\n\r\nSo make it simple for them. Many surgeons use templated notes for their common procedures. Great. Find out what information is not included in the template and work with the surgeons and your IT department to update the template to capture all of the information you need for a PCS code.\r\n\r\nAsk them to explain what they’re doing. Ask what they mean by certain terms. Many of them will be happy to share their expertise.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->Find out what the usual practice is and develop some facility-specific coding guidelines around them. For example, if your surgeon performs a lot of cardiac artery bypass graft (CABG) procedures, find out which vein they typically harvest—greater or lesser saphenous, right or left.\r\n\r\nCoders need that information to report a code for the harvest procedure (yes, we get to code that separately in PCS.) The surgeon may just dictate “harvest of saphenous vein.” We can’t code that. We need more information. Instead of querying the surgeon, you can create a default for your facility. See <em>Coding Clinic</em>, Third Quarter 2014, p. 8 for more specifics.\r\n\r\nIf your surgeons routinely use devices as ICD-10-PCS defines them (things that remain after the procedure is completed), they are probably documenting a brand name and a model. That could be a problem.\r\n\r\nFor example, a surgeon performs a hip replacement and documents the device as Stryker ADM X3. When you get to ICD-10-PCS table 0RS, you find these choices for a device:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>1, synthetic substitute, metal</li>\r\n	<li>2, synthetic substitute, metal on polyethylene</li>\r\n	<li>3, synthetic substitute, ceramic</li>\r\n	<li>4, synthetic substitute, ceramic on polyethylene</li>\r\n	<li>J, synthetic substitute</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWhich one is the ADM X3? You could Google it or visit the Stryker website. Or you could be proactive and find out before ICD-10 implementation what devices your surgeons use and create a cheat sheet to match the brands to the appropriate device character.\r\n\r\nOne caveat: devices change all of the time, so don’t create a list and forget to update it. Someone needs to keep an eye on what new devices your surgeons are using. Make that someone’s job. Don’t just assume someone else will do it.\r\n\r\nThat brings us to the final point for today—surgical queries. No one really wants to deal with surgical queries. We don’t want to send them and the surgeons don’t want to get them. Until ICD-10-PCS adds an unspecified character choice, we’re stuck with queries.\r\n\r\nHow do we get queries in front of the surgeons? It depends on the surgeon. So you need to invest some time getting to know your surgical staff. Keep in mind, they have approximately a 17-second attention span (according to Timothy Brundage, MS, CCDS, medical director of Brundage Medical Group in Redington Beach, Florida).\r\n\r\nYou need to be quick, concise, and polite. Ask them how they would like to receive queries. Make a list for all of the CDI specialists and coders, then use the surgeon’s preferred method of communication when you need to send a query. You’ll stay on the surgeon’s good side and probably get a quicker answer.\r\n\r\nOkay, good talk.',

Let’s take a look at some of the more challenging cases.\r\n\r\nAnytown held a Highland Horribles parade Friday night, complete with the worst-crafted floats (and worst-costumed participants) ever seen. That’s why it’s a “horrible” parade. One of the floats (complete with a fabulously fake Liberty Bell) unfortunately broke down halfway through the parade and several spectators came out to help push it out of the way.\r\n\r\nThe float collapsed as it was pushed off Main Street, and the bell, now at liberty from the float, went careening into the crowd. Most people were quick enough to get out of the way, but Bob was so busy critiquing the float removal crew that he didn’t see the giant fake bell coming at him.\r\n\r\nThe bell thankfully was not made of copper and tin, but rather of <em>papier</em>-<em>mâché</em> and chicken wire. Still, it was big enough to knock Bob down and he put out his hand to break his fall. He broke more than that. He also broke his arm.\r\n\r\nNot wanting to miss any of the festivities, Bob waited until today to come in the clinic. Dr. Setter sent Bob for x-rays and discovered a Colles’ fracture of the right arm. Hmm, I wonder if we can code that term? Maybe we’ll need to query Dr. Setter.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nFirst though, we check the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index and find that indeed, Colles’ fracture is a codeable term.\r\n\r\nWe know Bob broke his right arm, so we would report S52.531A (Colles\' fracture of right radius, initial encounter).\r\n\r\nAnytown held its annual fireworks extravaganza on the town common Saturday night, drawing a considerable crowd. Many residents and visitors showed up early to secure a good seat. While that plan sounded good, not everyone planned ahead for the heat.\r\n\r\nSylvia began complaining of a throbbing headache, dizziness, and light-headedness. Her friend Flo noticed Sylvia’s skin was hot and dry and convinced Sylvia to come into the clinic. Good thing, because Dr. Sunni Daze diagnosed heatstroke.\r\n\r\nHeatstroke itself is pretty easy to code. We have one code choice—T67.0- (heatstroke and sunstroke)—and three possible seventh characters.\r\n\r\nSince we know this is Sylvia’s first time seeking treatment and Dr. Daze is providing active treatment, our seventh character will be A, giving us a final code of T76.0XXA. Make sure you add the Xs or your code will be invalid.\r\n\r\nThe ICD-10-CM Tabular List also gives us some additional guidance for coding heatstroke.\r\n\r\nUnder category T67 (effects of heat and light), ICD-10-CM notes both Excludes1 and Excludes2 notes.\r\n\r\nExcludes1 means the conditions are mutually exclusive, so we can’t report heatstroke with:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Erythema [dermatitis] ab igne (L59.0)</li>\r\n	<li>Malignant hyperpyrexia due to anesthesia (T88.3)</li>\r\n	<li>Radiation-related disorders of the skin and subcutaneous tissue (L55-L59)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nHowever, the Excludes2 note means the conditions can be reported together, but are not represented by one code. So we can report heatstroke with additional codes for:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Burns (T20-T31)</li>\r\n	<li>Sunburn (L55.-)</li>\r\n	<li>Sweat disorder due to heat (L74-L75)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThose Excludes notes apply to all of the codes in the T76 category, so make sure you check the beginning of a category for notes, and not just the beginning of the subcategory.\r\n\r\nWe also have a note to use an additional code(s) to identify any associated complications of heatstroke, such as:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Coma and stupor (R40.-)</li>\r\n	<li>Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (R65.1-)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThat note is specific to T76.0-.\r\n\r\nNot all of our injuries happened during the day. Twelve-year-olds Nick and John became very restless waiting for the fireworks to start, so as dusk approached they took two very long sparklers, lit them, and engaged in a lightsaber battle. Needless to say, this didn’t end well.\r\n\r\nNick suffered multiple burns on his hands from the sparks shed by the sparkler. John avoided injuries, but is now grounded until he’s 18.\r\n\r\nTo code burns in ICD-10-CM, we need to know the site and severity. Dr. Daze documented multiple first-degree burns to Nick’s right and left hands and wrists, including multiple fingers on each hand. We do need to know if any of the burns were to Nick’s thumbs or just his fingers. Dr. Daze’s documentation does not mention thumbs, so fingers it is.\r\n\r\nWe’re going to report four codes for the burns—each hand gets its own code and each group of fingers has its own code. So we would report:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>T23.191A, burn of first degree of multiple sites of right wrist and hand, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>T23.192A, burn of first degree of multiple sites of left wrist and hand</li>\r\n	<li>T23.131A, burn of first degree of multiple right fingers (nail), not including thumb</li>\r\n	<li>T23.132, burn of first degree of multiple left fingers (nail), not including thumb</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAs supplemental information, we can also report T31.0 (burns involving less than 10% of body surface).\r\n\r\nWe also have a note to use additional external cause code(s) to identify the source, place, and intent of the burn (X00-X19, X75-X77, X96-X98, Y92).\r\n\r\nBecause sparklers are essentially burning metal, we would report X18.XXXA (contact with other hot metals, initial encounter).\r\n\r\nWe can skip X75-X77 because Nick was not trying to hurt himself. I would not report a code from Z96-X98 either because this wasn’t really an assault. It was a pair of 12-year-olds who didn’t know any better.\r\n\r\nFor our place of occurrence, we would report Y92.830 (public park as the place of occurrence of the external cause). No seventh character needed for this code.\r\n\r\nWith that, we’re done coding our Fourth of July injuries and I for one look forward to a week with fewer explosions.',

You can now talk to physicians confidently about the ICD-10 deadline and work with them throughout the yearlong transition to improve their documentation for you to choose the most appropriate, and specific, code.\r\n\r\nYou can forget about delays, waiting for ICD-11, and any other excuses you’ve heard about pushing off training for the transition. With the AMA and CMS working together, ICD-10 is certainly coming in just 86 days.',

I mean, really, really strange things.\r\n\r\nTake Mike, for example. Mike just returned from his European vacation and has come into the Fix ‘Em Up Clinic for a follow-up visit for injuries suffered during his trip. Did I mention he was in Pamplona, Spain? You know, where they let the bulls chase people through the streets.\r\n\r\nMike thought it would be fun to try and outrun a 2,000-pound enraged bovine through twisty streets in a town he’d never visited before.\r\n\r\nThis wasn’t Mike’s best plan. In fact, one of the bulls not only caught the fleeing vacationer, he gored Mike in the armpit. The Spanish doctors patched Mike up and sent him back to America.\r\n\r\nDr. Horn is seeing Mike for follow-up treatment of the wound. But what kind of wound is it? Dr. Horn’s notes say Mike was gored by a bull. The ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index doesn’t include gore or gored as terms.\r\n\r\nFortunately, Dr. Horn also documents that Mike has a deep puncture wound as a result of being gored.\r\n\r\nWhen we look up “puncture” in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index, we find a wonderfully long list of puncture sites. However, the list does not include “armpit.” Okay, thinking back to anatomy class, what is a more clinical term for armpit? Oh, I’ve got it—axilla!\r\n\r\n<!--more-->The index does include axilla, but it tells us to “see Puncture, arm.” Thanks a lot.\r\n\r\nThe listing for arm under puncture includes the nonessential modifier upper, so we’re in the right place (S41.13-).\r\n\r\nRemember that nonessential modifiers—terms in parentheses—are additional descriptive words that may or may not be present. If the physician just documented arm puncture, we would still use the same code. If the physician documented a lower arm puncture, we would report a different code (S51.84-).\r\n\r\nOur S41.13- code needs two additional characters. The sixth character denotes laterality. Right arm or left arm? We do have a code for unspecified arm, but in this case, we don’t need it. Dr. Horn documented right arm, giving us S41.132-.\r\n\r\nThe seventh character is our episode of care and this could get a little tricky. Category S41 (open wound of should and upper arm) includes three seventh character choices:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>A, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>D, subsequent encounter</li>\r\n	<li>S, sequela</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSince Dr. Horn did not document any late effects of the goring, we can eliminate S. But is this an initial or a subsequent visit?\r\n\r\nDon’t be fooled by the term “initial” for A. Think of seventh character A as active treatment. It doesn’t matter if Mike is seeing a new physician. What matters is the kind of treatment Mike receives. That’s a little bit of a change from past years, so you really need to keep on top of the guidelines.\r\n\r\nHow can we tell if Mike is receiving active treatment or follow-up care? Dr. Horn called the visit a follow up. Is that enough to assign seventh character D?\r\n\r\nNo. The title of an operative report or a visit note may not accurately reflect what the physician did. Dr. Horn may be calling this a follow up since Mike was previously seen for the injury, but Dr. Horn may still be providing active treatment.\r\n\r\nLook at what Dr. Horn actually did. You may need to ask if Dr. Horn considers the treatment to be active or just routine follow up. Be prepared for the physician to be a little unsure as well. Unfortunately, there’s not bright line separating active treatment from routine follow-up care. The physician may not know.\r\n\r\n<em>The ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting</em> offer some examples of active and subsequent care, but it’s by no means a comprehensive list.\r\n\r\nOne other piece of information may be missing from subsequent visits (or active treatment after the first visit). Did a foreign body remain in the wound? Unless Dr. Horn asks Mike and documents the answer, you have to go with no foreign body. That detail could make some of our data less precise, but we can’t code from past records. If it’s not documented, you can’t code it.\r\n\r\nDr. Horn sends Mike on his way with an admonition to avoid large angry animals in the future and recommends a more relaxing vacation next time. Anyone want to go to the beach?',

I knew him, Horatio, a condition of infinite vagueness. And thankfully, one ICD-10-CM is putting out to pasture. Now, if only the physicians would get on board.\r\n\r\nPhysicians frequently use the term urosepsis to refer to a systemic inflammatory response initiating from a urinary source, but without further detail in ICD-9-CM this diagnosis defaults to a urinary tract infection (UTI) with code 599.0.\r\n\r\nSo is the patient septic or does the patient have a UTI? Or does the patient have sepsis secondary to the UTI?\r\n\r\nBased on documentation of “urosepsis,” you can’t tell. Coders often query physicians to clarify whether they are documenting a UTI or sepsis.\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM does not include the term urosepsis. The <em>ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting</em> state:\r\n\r\n<em>The term urosepsis is a nonspecific term. It is not to be considered synonymous with sepsis. It has no default code in the Alphabetic Index. Should a provider use this term, he/she must be queried for clarification.</em>\r\n\r\nPhysicians are going to love that (not at all).\r\n\r\nPart of the problem may be the way physicians view documentation. Physicians are taught to document for other physicians, not for coders. Physicians can also interpret clinical information that another physician documents, but coders can’t interpret. We can only query for clarification.\r\n\r\nSadly, urosepsis isn’t the only problem term related to sepsis. Physicians often use the terms “bacteremia,” “septicemia,” and “sepsis” interchangeably, even though those terms refer to different clinical conditions.\r\n\r\nLearn how sepsis coding will change in ICD-10-CM and when to query physicians for additional information during the live webcast, <a href=\"http://hcmarketplace.com/prepare-for-sepsis-documentation-coding-in-icd-10-cm\">Prepare for Sepsis Documentation &amp; Coding in ICD-10-CM.</a> During this 90-minute webcast at 1 p.m. (Eastern) Friday, July 31, Gloryanne Bryant, RHIA, RHIT, CCS, CDIP, CCDS, AHIMA-approved ICD-10-CM/PCS trainer and Robert S. Gold, MD, will review sepsis clinical information as well as the ICD-10-CM guidelines for coding sepsis. In addition, they will offer best practices for coding and documentation in ICD-10-CM, including physician queries.',

Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., and Tom E. Price, R-Ga., introduced <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/3018/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%223018%22%5D%7D\">H.R. 3018,</a> the Code-FLEX Act, July 10 to allow submission of ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for 180 days after implementation.\r\n\r\nIt’s hard to believe another six months would be a panacea for providers who aren’t quite ready to implement ICD-10. ICD-10 has been delayed multiple times, giving providers sufficient time to prepare for the transition.\r\n\r\nThe idea behind dual coding after the transition isn’t new—and the same arguments against them still exist. At the February House Energy and Commerce Committee’s subcommittee on healthcare hearing on ICD-10, Carmella Bocchino, representing America’s Health Insurance Plans, <a href=\"http://journal.ahima.org/2015/02/11/icd-10-congressional-hearing-panelists-debate-implementation-myths-industry-impact-and-readiness/\">testified that</a> running dual systems would be both costly and confusing.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nIt’s easy to understand why. This would force payers to maintain two different systems and National Coverage Determinations would have to be maintained for both ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM. And what kind of a nightmare would that be for tracking episodes of care or other information if a patient sees a primary care provider (PCP) who reports in ICD-9-CM, then sees a specialist reporting in ICD-10-CM, then returns to the PCP?\r\n\r\nIt’s also hard to tell if the bill is only intended for physician practices. It doesn’t specify, referring to all healthcare claims processed by public and private payers. It wouldn’t be the first time Congress missed such a detail. The same vagaries cropped up <a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/2015/06/latest-icd-10-bill-shows-ama-congress-flailing-to-find-a-way-out-of-implementation/\">in its last ICD-10 bill.</a>\r\n\r\nThis bill will most likely fail to even make it out of committee, just like every other ICD-10 bill representatives introduced this year. With CMS and the AMA already issuing a joint statement that appears to signal a détente, it’s unlikely the agency will incorporate any type of dual coding before implementation.',

You had to pick who you wanted in your group and they had to pick you. It was very confusing trying to figure out who was in the family and who wasn’t.\r\n\r\nCMS created the same kind of confusion last week when it basically cut a deal with the American Medical Association (AMA). The AMA, you may recall, has been <a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/2015/05/einstein-was-right/\">very vocally opposed to ICD-10</a> being implemented in any way, shape, or form.\r\n\r\nTo get AMA to cease and desist its defiance, CMS gave AMA something it wanted: no penalties for some coding errors and advanced payments if the technology goes kerflooey.\r\n\r\nI can totally understand advancing payments if the system doesn’t work. That’s pretty straightforward. The physician gets paid on time and doesn’t have to worry about going under because of something he or she can’t control. The physicians will have to repay the advanced payment once the system is running smoothly, so they aren’t getting extra money. They just get a hedge against a Y2K meltdown.\r\n\r\nThe confusing part of the pact is the hold harmless for miscoding. AMA initially wanted physicians to get <a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/2015/06/what-is-a-coding-error/\">a pass on coding errors for two years.</a> I’m pretty sure AMA knew that wasn’t going to fly, but when you negotiate, you always start high.\r\n\r\nIn the final deal, CMS stated auditors will not deny a claim “based solely on the specificity of the ICD-10 diagnosis code as long as the physician/practitioner used a valid code from the right family.”\r\n\r\n<!--more-->CMS does not, however, define a family of codes. Is it a category of codes, such as S00, superficial injury of head? That could be interesting. S00 has nine subcategories of codes, each with their own subcategories.\r\n\r\nOr does CMS mean those subcategories, say S00.4, superficial injury of ear? Again, S00.4 includes eight subcategories with their own subcategories.\r\n\r\nMaybe CMS considers a family to be the smallest group of subcategories. So under S00, we could go all the way down to S00.46-, insect bite (nonvenomous) of ear as a family. That would give us three codes in the family:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>461, insect bite (nonvenomous) of right ear</li>\r\n	<li>462, insect bite (nonvenomous) of left ear</li>\r\n	<li>469, insect bite (nonvenomous) of unspecified ear</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThat seems reasonable. The only missing information is the laterality. Not a huge deal, but really the physician should be documenting it. Maybe the coder just couldn’t find it or was in a hurry and defaulted to unspecified.\r\n\r\nLet’s consider open wounds of the eyelid and periocular area (S01.1). This is a subcategory under open wound of the head (S01). We’ve already narrowed it down to a specific area.\r\n\r\nThe question becomes, is everything under S01.1- a family? I hope not. Here’s why. The first subcategory under S01.1- is S01.10- (unspecified open wound of eyelid and periocular area). S01.10- further specifies laterality:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>101-, unspecified open wound of right eyelid and periocular area</li>\r\n	<li>102-, unspecified open wound of left eyelid and periocular area</li>\r\n	<li>109-, unspecified open wound of unspecified eyelid and periocular area</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThat last one’s a killer because it tells you nothing. No wound type, no laterality.\r\n\r\nAdditional subcategories under S01.1- specify the type of wound:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Laceration with (S01.12-) and without foreign body (S01.111)</li>\r\n	<li>Puncture wound with (S01.14-) and without (S01.131) foreign body</li>\r\n	<li>Open bite (S01.15)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nI can see not penalizing someone for failing to reporting the “without foreign body” code instead of requiring coders to query if the physician doesn’t document that no foreign body remained in the wound. The question of with or without foreign body becomes tricky when you start looking at subsequent encounters.\r\n\r\nIf S01.1- is a family, claims won’t be denied if you report S01.109- instead of S01.132- (puncture wound without foreign body of left eyelid and periocular area).\r\n\r\nFractures will be even more confusing, largely because ICD-10 includes so many variations of fracture codes.\r\n\r\nWhat about specificity for diseases, such as diabetes? Where do you draw the family line? Is it the type of diabetes? So all codes under E11 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus) are one family?\r\n\r\nOr do you go to the first subcategory and say all codes under E11.3- (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with ophthalmic complications) are the same family and therefore we won’t deny the claim if you have any E11.3- code.\r\n\r\nMaybe CMS goes one step further and really narrows down the family to E11.31- (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with unspecified diabetic retinopathy), which includes two codes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>311, Type 2 diabetes mellitus with unspecified diabetic retinopathy with macular edema</li>\r\n	<li>319, Type 2 diabetes mellitus with unspecified diabetic retinopathy without macularedema</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe don’t know. I’m not convinced CMS knows at this point.\r\n\r\nSomething else we don’t know—how does this deal with AMA affect hospitals? CMS and AMA both only reference Part B physician fee schedule claims. What about Part A claims? Is CMS going to extend the same breaks to hospitals? Again, we don’t know.\r\n\r\nCMS may have finally gotten the AMA on board with ICD-10, but it sure created a lot of additional confusion along the way.',

The potential source of this explosion (to use the term <em>very</em> loosely) of cases: armadillos.\r\n\r\nDon’t panic, though. Florida typically sees <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/health/rise-of-leprosy-cases-in-florida-blamed-on-armadillos/2238117\">10 cases of leprosy per year</a>. In the first half of 2015, the number of cases has already reached nine. Nine people does not a real outbreak make, but it is enough to make the <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/21/health/florida-leprosy-cases-armadillos-irpt/\">national</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-33628312\">international</a> news.\r\n\r\nOfficials are blaming contact with armadillos for the spike in leprosy cases. Personally, I’m not interested in shaking paws with an armadillo (or any wild animal for that matter), but some people just want to embrace nature.\r\n\r\nSome armadillos also like to spit at people (usually when the armadillo is in a cage). <em>Mycobacterium leprae</em> bacteria, which causes leprosy, can be transmitted through spit.\r\n\r\nFortunately, leprosy is hard to contract (<a href=\"http://www.leprosy.org/leprosy-faqs/\">most people are actually immune to it</a>). However, all nine people who contracted leprosy in Florida this year reported contact with armadillos and some nine-banded armadillos do carry leprosy. They are the only animals that do, by the way. Sadly, they do not also carry signs telling you they are leprosy positive.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->The miracles of modern medicine (namely antibiotics) have cured leprosy, so if you contract it and get treated promptly, you don’t have to worry about losing fingers and toes.\r\n\r\nIn ICD-10-CM, we will use codes from category A30 (leprosy [Hansen\'s disease]) and choose from:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>0, indeterminate leprosy (I leprosy)</li>\r\n	<li>1, tuberculoid leprosy (TT leprosy)</li>\r\n	<li>2, borderline tuberculoid leprosy (BT leprosy)</li>\r\n	<li>3, borderline leprosy (BB leprosy)</li>\r\n	<li>4, borderline lepromatous leprosy (BL leprosy)</li>\r\n	<li>5, lepromatous leprosy (LL leprosy)</li>\r\n	<li>8, other forms of leprosy</li>\r\n	<li>9, leprosy, unspecified</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nRemember that you can use A30.9 if the physician doesn’t specify the subtype of leprosy. The <em>ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting </em>even tell us we can use an unspecified code when the physician doesn’t have more information. The guidelines also tell us not to do a lab test just to get a more specific code.\r\n\r\nIf your physician is good with treating leprosy without know the particular type, you can report A30.9.\r\n\r\nThe only other thing we could code is external cause codes for being spit on by an armadillo as the cause of leprosy. Remember that we don’t have to report external cause codes and sadly, we don\'t have a code specifically for encounter with an armadillo. We would have to default to other contact with other mammals (W55.89XA) if the armadillo spit on our patient. W55 (contact with other mammals) includes contact with saliva, feces, or urine of mammal so we\'ve got the spit covered, just not the specificity of armadillo.\r\n\r\nAll the same, I think I will steer clear of them.',

For the first year of ICD-10 use, CMS will not deny or audit claims based solely on the specificity of diagnosis codes, as long as the codes on such claims are from the correct family of codes.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, CMS didn’t specify at the time what it meant by “family of codes.” Apparently, a lot of people raised questions about just how CMS’ plan would work because the agency released <a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Clarifying-Questions-and-Answers-Related-to-the-July-6-2015-CMS-AMA-Joint-Announcement.pdf\">Clarifying Questions and Answers Related to the July 6, 2015 CMS/AMA Joint Announcement and Guidance Regarding ICD-10 Flexibilities.</a> The document includes 13 questions and answers, including three focused on the family of codes.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->What to know what a family is? See question 5. According to CMS, a “family of codes” is the same as the ICD-10 three-character category.\r\n\r\nI so don’t love that answer. Here’s why.\r\n\r\nConsider S31 (open wound of abdomen, lower back, pelvis, and external genitals). CMS says this is a family of codes. A total of 450 codes fall within that family. Those codes represent a wide range of injuries.\r\n\r\nSo theoretically, you could report S31.821D (laceration without foreign body of left buttock, subsequent encounter) when the patient really suffered S31.652A (open bite of abdominal wall, epigastric region with penetration into peritoneal cavity, initial encounter). CMS would not audit or deny that claim because you reported a valid code within the family.\r\n\r\nHowever, here’s the catch—CMS never said it wouldn’t deny or audit claims for medical necessity.\r\n\r\nRemember that seventh character A means active treatment, while D refers to routine aftercare.\r\n\r\nLet’s say our patient with a bite wound develops an infection in the wound site and the physician decides the best course of treatment is to debride the tissue. S31.821D is not going support the medical necessity of a wound debridement. CMS will likely deny the claim even though you reported a valid code within the family.\r\n\r\nQuestion 6 provides another caveat. CMS can deny a claim if the code reported does not meet the requirements of a Local Coverage Determination (LCD) or National Coverage Determination (NCD). CMS even states, “current automated claims processing edits are not being modified as a result of the guidance.”\r\n\r\nMove on to question 7 for some additional information about the LCDs and NCDs. NCDs and LCDs often require you to report specific codes. The level of specificity required for ICD-10-CM will be the same as that required in ICD-9-CM. With one major exception—laterality. ICD-9-CM does not specify laterality. ICD-10-CM does.\r\n\r\nIf an LCD or NCD includes codes that specify laterality, coders cannot use a code for unspecified laterality to meet that requirement. So if your physicians aren’t documenting laterality, you aren’t meeting the LCD or NCD requirements. Auditors can go back and review those claims. You don’t get a pass just because you reported a code in the correct family.\r\n\r\nMoral of the story—make sure you report the most specific code.',

After performing a complete exam and blood tests, Dr. Guts diagnoses Alex with a bleeding peptic ulcer.\r\n\r\nDr. Guts determines that Alex needs surgery to control the bleeding.\r\n\r\nDr. Guts has plenty of techniques to choose from to stop the bleeding. She can cauterize the ulcer or inject medication. In Alex’s case, she decided to clip the ulcer to stop the blood flow.\r\n\r\nGenerally, this surgery is performed in the outpatient setting, but our crack coders at Stitch ‘Em Up Hospital are coding it for ICD-10-PCS so they can compare inpatient and outpatient data.\r\n\r\nSo how are they coding this procedure?\r\n\r\nWe know we’re in the Medical and Surgical section (first character 0). We know we’re in the gastrointestinal body system (second character D).\r\n\r\n<!--more-->What is our root operation? What is Dr. Guts trying to do? Well, she’s trying to control the bleeding, so maybe our root operation is Control.\r\n\r\nThe definition of Control in the <em>ICD-10-PCS Manual</em> is “stopping, or attempting to stop, postprocedural bleeding.” Clearly Control is not our root operation. Alex has an ulcer, not bleeding after another procedure.\r\n\r\nWhat about Occlusion (completely closing an orifice or the lumen of a tubular body part)? Dr. Guts is clipping the blood vessel to stop it from bleeding. However, she is not totally occluding an artery and she’s certainly not occluding part of the GI tract. So Occlusion is out.\r\n\r\nWhat’s left? The not elsewhere classified root operation Repair (restoring, to the extent possible, a body part to its normal anatomic structure and function). Repair is the root operation you use when nothing else quite fits.\r\n\r\nOkay, we now know we’re on table 0DQ.\r\n\r\nNow we need a body part. We have quite a few to choose from, including four for the esophagus (upper, middle, lower, esophagus) alone.\r\n\r\nWe need Dr. Guts to be very specific about where the bleeding ulcer is located. Fortunately, Dr. Guts is an ace documenter and we find the following information in her operative report:\r\n\r\n<em>Use EDG to reach site of bleeding ulcer at proximal end of duodenum. Placed clips to control bleeding from artery.</em>\r\n\r\nThat gives us all of the information we need to finish building our code.\r\n\r\nTable 0DQ includes a body part character for the duodenum (9).\r\n\r\nAn EGD (esophagogastroduodenoscopy) is a diagnostic procedure during which the physician inserts long, flexible, lighted tube called an endoscope through the patient\'s mouth and throat, then through the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. The surgeon insert instruments, such as clips, through the endoscope and perform a surgical procedure. That gives us our approach: via natural or artificial opening, endoscopic (8).\r\n\r\nThe last two characters are easy because Z is our only choice for both. Our final code is 0DQ98ZZ.<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/blood-drop.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-3008\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/blood-drop-224x300.jpg\" alt=\"blood drop\" width=\"224\" height=\"300\" /></a>',

Literally. And you can’t see them or feel them. In fact, trillions of them are living on your skin right now. So not all bacteria are bad.\r\n\r\nSome, though, can do nasty things.\r\n\r\nConsider <em>Legionella pneumophila</em> bacteria. These nasty guys are responsible for at least seven deaths in <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/01/health/new-york-legionnaires-disease/\">New York City Legionnaires\' disease outbreak</a>. At least 64 people have been hospitalized.\r\n\r\nLegionnaires’ disease falls under category A48 (other bacterial diseases, not elsewhere classified) in ICD-10-CM. That’s a new home for the disease. In ICD-9-CM, the code for Legionnaires’ disease falls under diseases of the respiratory system (482.84, in case you’re interested).\r\n\r\nThe disease itself hasn’t changed. It’s just been moved from respiratory to infectious diseases.\r\n\r\nWe also get a second code for Legionnaires’ disease in ICD-10-CM: A48.2 (nonpneumonic Legionnaires\' disease [Pontiac fever]). We don’t have a code for Pontiac fever in ICD-9-CM.\r\n\r\nLegionnaires\' disease is a type of pneumonia. Pontiac fever is a less severe, flu-like condition caused by the same bacteria.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->Bacteria are also responsible for a host of other conditions, including necrotizing fasciitis. In ICD-10-CM, we only have one code: M72.6. However, we also have a note instructing us to use an additional code (B95.-, B96.-) to identify causative organism.\r\n\r\nOur choices are:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><em>Streptococcus</em>, <em>Staphylococcus</em>, and <em>Enterococcus</em> as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere (category B95.-)</li>\r\n	<li>Other bacterial agents as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere (B96.-)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBacteria, specifically <em>Brucella,</em> are also a really good reason to make sure your food is cooked. <em>Brucella </em>bacteria can cause brucellosis, which manifests with fever, back pain, night sweats, poor appetite, and headaches.\r\n\r\nBrucellosis comes in four different strains and your symptoms depend on which one you have. So will code selection. ICD-10-CM includes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>0, brucellosis due to <em>Brucella melitensis</em></li>\r\n	<li>1, brucellosis due to <em>Brucella abortus</em></li>\r\n	<li>2, brucellosis due to <em>Brucella suis</em></li>\r\n	<li>3, brucellosis due to <em>Brucella canis</em></li>\r\n	<li>8, other brucellosis</li>\r\n	<li>9, brucellosis, unspecified</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWhat if you don’t know the causative organism? Do you need to query the physician and ask him or her to test for it? No. In fact, the physician shouldn’t do a test just so we can report a more specific code. The <a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/ICD10/Downloads/2016-ICD-10-CM-Guidelines.pdf\"><em>ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting</em></a> tell us so:\r\n\r\n<em>When sufficient clinical information isn’t known or available about a particular health condition to assign a more specific code, it is acceptable to report the appropriate “unspecified” code (e.g., a diagnosis of pneumonia has been determined, but not the specific type). Unspecified codes should be reported when they are the codes that most accurately reflect what is known about the patient’s condition at the time of that particular encounter. It would be inappropriate to select a specific code that is not supported by the medical record documentation or conduct medically unnecessary diagnostic testing in order to determine a more specific code.</em>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI think I’ll skip the steak tartare.',

However, they might not need much help, according to the <a href=\"http://www.wedi.org/news/press-releases/2015/08/03/wedi-icd-10-survey-results-industry-nearing-readiness-but-physician-practices-lagging-behind\">latest Workgroup for Electronic Data Interchange (WEDI) survey.</a>\r\n\r\nApproximately 88% of hospitals that responded to the survey expect to be ready for ICD-10 by implementation, with only one respondent anticipating not being ready and 10% unsure.\r\n\r\nPhysician practices fared worse on this question. Less than 50% said they would be ready, with nearly 25% said they would not be ready and more than 25% are unsure. WEDI conducted the survey of 453 providers, 96 health plans, and 72 vendors in June.\r\n\r\nPhysician practices also lagged in testing, with approximately 20% in some stage of external testing with vendors compared to nearly 75% of hospitals.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nHospitals are taking advantage of CMS’ end-to-end testing weeks and ongoing acknowledgment testing far more frequently than physician practices. Approximately 60% of hospitals have tested with Medicare, while less than 17% of physician practices have taken the same step.\r\n\r\nAnother concern is the number of providers planning to use crosswalks to produce ICD-10 codes instead of coding directly. Less than 20% of hospitals plan to use crosswalks, but nearly 66% of physician practices plan to use them. While crosswalks are a helpful tool for coding, <a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/2014/10/use-gems-as-a-starting-point-not-an-end-point/\">they’re not meant to replace native coding. </a>\r\n\r\nThe survey isn’t all bad news. Vendors are increasingly ready for ICD-10, with 75% reporting their software and services are ready, a big increase from less than 60% in the February 2015 survey. No vendors reported their products would not be ready by implementation.\r\n\r\nAnother important piece of news is that uncertainty is no longer the leading obstacle to implementation, <a href=\"http://www.hcpro.com/HIM-315134-859/Providers-greatest-obstacle-to-ICD10-preparations-could-soon-be-removed.html\">as it was in the February survey.</a> Fewer providers, health plans, and vendors cited uncertainty as a top concern, meaning that organizations are finally recognizing that ICD-10 is coming and the best thing they can do is prepare.\r\n\r\nCMS’ guidance regarding specificity should assuage some fears for physician practices, but it doesn’t mean they can ignore ICD-10, especially since other payers may require specific codes and<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/2015/07/meet-the-family/\"> those codes may be required to meet Local and National Coverage Determination requirements.</a>\r\n\r\nWhile the survey shows the industry more prepared than ever for ICD-10, the hardest work may still be ahead for many organizations.\r\n\r\nNeed some refresher training?

Yep, I’m talking about the instruction manual.\r\n\r\nAnd okay, the official guidelines won’t tell you <em>everything</em>. But they are a great place to start.\r\n\r\nSeveral years ago, I attended a conference session on tough ICD-9-CM coding challenges. One of the very first things the speaker said was read, learn, and love the guidelines. True in ICD-9-CM, true in ICD-10-CM, and true in ICD-10-PCS.\r\n\r\nI can tell when people have read the directions by the questions they ask. Sometimes, the answers are clearly spelled out in the guidelines. Other times, I need to look in <em>Coding Clinic</em>, or reach out to one of <a href=\"http://hcmarketplace.com/bootcamps/staff\">our Boot Camp instructors</a> for help.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->They know when I haven’t checked the guidelines, but they are very nice about pointing out where to look in the guidelines.\r\n\r\nIf you haven’t already done so, download the guidelines from either <a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/ICD10/index.html?redirect=/icd10\">CMS</a> or the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/icd/icd10cm.htm\">CDC</a>. You can also download the actual codes and indexes. I also recommend downloading the <a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/ICD10/2016-ICD-10-PCS-and-GEMs.html\"><em>ICD-10-PCS Reference Manual</em></a>. It’s very helpful and helpfully free.\r\n\r\nOnce you download the guidelines, you do need to read them. They will not magically appear in your brain, even if you sleep with the book beneath your pillow. I tried that.\r\n\r\nThankfully the majority of guidelines (and conventions) remain the same in ICD-10-CM. So if you know and love your ICD-9-CM guidelines, learning the ICD-10-CM ones will be easy.\r\n\r\nThe news isn’t as nice for ICD-10-PCS. Inpatient coders and CDI specialists are starting from scratch here. So it’s even more important to Read The Guidelines! And the reference manual. And <em>Coding Clinic</em>. But read the guidelines first. The other two will make more sense if you do.\r\n\r\nIf you have questions (and you probably will), ask—ask a colleague, ask your boss, ask <em>Coding Clinic</em>, in some cases, use the JustCoding Facebook page to ask everyone online, search the JustCoding archives.

And some of our local players practice a little too hard.<a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Football.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-3018\" src=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Football-300x201.jpg\" alt=\"Football\" width=\"300\" height=\"201\" /></a>\r\n\r\nTake Shaun, for example. Shaun is the kicker for Anytown’s high school football team. While making a routine tackle in practice, Shaun’s knee connected with another player’s helmet and he had to be helped off the field.\r\n\r\nShaun comes in to see Dr. Landry at the Fix ‘Em Up Clinic. After an MRI, Dr. Landry diagnoses a grade 3 tear of the left anterior cruciate ligament. Dr. Landry recommends surgery to replace the ligament.\r\n\r\nWhen we look up a torn ligament in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index, we’re directed to “see Sprain.” Once you know ligament tears are classified as sprains, you can head right there in the index.\r\n\r\nYou can look up “cruciate” under sprain, but you will be directed to the knee so we’ll just head right there.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->The knee includes four ligaments:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Anterior cruciate</li>\r\n	<li>Posterior cruciate</li>\r\n	<li>Lateral collateral</li>\r\n	<li>Medial collateral</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nEach ligament subcategory includes specificity for laterality.\r\n\r\nWe know the specific ligament Shaun tore and we know the laterality. That makes it easy to reach code S83.512A (sprain of anterior cruciate ligament of left knee, initial encounter).\r\n\r\nA quick reminder about seventh characters. The <em>ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting</em> provide some specific guidance on seventh characters. Coders should report A when the patient is receiving active treatment. Use seventh character D when the patient is receiving routine care in the healing phase.\r\n\r\nIt doesn’t matter whether the patient sees a new physician every visit or sees a specialist instead of a primary care physician. The actual care provided will determine the seventh character.\r\n\r\nNow, where were we? Oh, right, Shaun’s knee injury.\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM doesn’t (yet) classify sprains by grade, so we’re using the same code regardless of severity. We can also add some additional external cause codes to fill in the details about how and when Shaun’s injury occurred:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>W21.81XA, striking against or struck by football helmet, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>Y92.321, football field as the place of occurrence of the external cause</li>\r\n	<li>Y93.61, activity, American tackle football</li>\r\n	<li>Y99.8, other external cause status</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nOnly the first code needs a seventh character and it is the only code that will carry through the record. Remember also that you may not need to report external cause codes. They are optional on most records, although some states and payers do require them.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;',

We’ve only got 31 working days until October 1.\r\n\r\nIf you are all set for ICD-10, you’re probably fine tuning your coding and documentation, maybe looking at what improvements you can make to your EMR.\r\n\r\nIf you’re mostly ready, you’re probably scrambling to figure out what absolutely, positively must be done by October 1.\r\n\r\nIf you aren’t ready at all, you’re in panic mode.\r\n\r\nFor those of you in the first group, congratulations! You made the most of the multiple delays and you’re ready for any hiccups you encounter after implementation.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->For those in the second group, <strong>Shannon E. McCall, RHIA, CCS, CCS-P, CPC, CPC-I, CEMC, CCDS,</strong> director of coding and HIM for HCPro, a division of BLR, in Danvers, Massachusetts, offers some last-minute focus areas:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Ensure that operative reports contain adequate documentation in order to support all seven characters required for correct ICD-10-PCS assignment</li>\r\n	<li>Expect productivity decreases at first with ICD-10 implementation and plan accordingly so that revenue is not impacted more than necessary</li>\r\n	<li>Plan on organized meetings to identify and communicate documentation issues encountered on a weekly or biweekly basis to ensure you are focusing your energy on the biggest areas of concern</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThings aren’t quite so rosy for those in the third group, which includes a fair number of physician practices, at least if you believe <a href=\"http://blogs.hcpro.com/icd-10/2015/08/physician-practices-lag-far-behind-hospitals-in-readiness-survey/\">recent ICD-10 readiness surveys</a>.\r\n\r\nIf you are not going to be ready for ICD-10 October 1, don’t give up (or give in to panic). Make a realistic assessment of where you are, then prioritize. What tasks must be completed before implementation? What can you work on post-implementation?\r\n\r\nNow, the hard part: create a feasible plan for completing as many of the remaining tasks as possible, get everyone on board, and start working. Remember, a goal without a plan is just a wish.\r\n\r\nShannon also offered some final thoughts: “Good communication and a team effort is the best way to tackle the upcoming challenges. It\'s a new system for everyone, so strength in numbers!”\r\n\r\n&nbsp;',

Here at the Fix ‘Em Up Clinic, we are happy to share our knowledge as we prepare for October 1. In that spirit, we present the following case sent to us from Florida.\r\n\r\nTim and a large group of friends were out biking on a Florida highway when they came across the body of a baby alligator. The alligator suffered multiple crushing injuries as a result of being run over by a really big truck.\r\n\r\nThe alligator may have been squished, but that didn’t stop it from taking out some cyclists from the hereafter. Several of the cyclists, who were cruising at around 30 miles per hour, hit the baby gator’s body and then the pavement.\r\n\r\nTim suffered the most severe injuries, breaking five ribs, several facial bones, and his clavicle. He also suffered a collapsed lung.\r\n\r\nLet’s start at the top of Tim and work our way down.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->For Tim’s facial fractures, we need to know which bones he broke. ICD-10-CM includes codes for:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>0-, vault of skull</li>\r\n	<li>1-, base of skull</li>\r\n	<li>2-, nasal bones</li>\r\n	<li>3-, orbital floor</li>\r\n	<li>4-, malar, maxillary and zygoma bones (you’ll find codes for LeFort fractures here as well)</li>\r\n	<li>6- mandible (10 possible locations)</li>\r\n	<li>8-, other specified skull and facial bones</li>\r\n	<li>9-, unspecified skull and facial bones</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nEach code requires a seventh character for the encounter, and we’ll report one code for each location.\r\n\r\nWe checked with our Florida colleagues, who told us Tim fractured both cheekbones and his forehead. Even though Tim suffered three fractures, we’ll only report two codes:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>0XXA, fracture of vault of skull, initial encounter</li>\r\n	<li>402A, zygomatic fracture, unspecified, initial encounter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe vault of the skull includes the frontal bone (your forehead). The ICD-10-CM Tabular List kindly includes that information under S02.0-.\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM codes for facial fractures do not denote laterality, so if a patient fractures both cheekbones, like Tim, we only report one code.\r\n\r\nOn to the clavicle fracture. We need to know laterality for this break as well as where on the bone the break occurred. Our choices include:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>00-, unspecified part of clavicle</li>\r\n	<li>01-, sternal end of clavicle (anterior displaced, posterior displaced, nondisplaced)</li>\r\n	<li>02-, shaft of clavicle (displaced or nondisplaced)</li>\r\n	<li>03-, lateral end of clavicle (displaced or nondisplaced)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nOur Florida friends told us Tim fractured the shaft of his right clavicle, but didn’t tell us whether the fracture is open or closed, displaced, or nondisplaced. Defaults to the rescue!\r\n\r\nICD-10-CM instructs us to use closed and displaced as defaults when the information is not available.\r\n\r\nThat gives us S42.021A (displaced fracture of shaft of right clavicle, closed, initial encounter).\r\n\r\nFor the rib fractures, we again need laterality and a seventh character for the encounter:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>41-, multiple fractures of ribs, right side</li>\r\n	<li>42-, multiple fractures of ribs, left side</li>\r\n	<li>43-, multiple fractures of ribs, bilateral</li>\r\n	<li>49-, multiple fractures of ribs, unspecified side</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThat brings us to Tim’s collapsed lung. If you look up lung in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index, you’re directed to see condition. When you look up collapse, lung, you find the non-essential modifier (massive) and a note to see also Atelectasis.\r\n\r\nAtelectasis is a fancy (Greek) word for a complete or partial collapse of a lung or lobe of a lung. Almost everyone who has surgery under general anesthesia suffers some degree of atelectasis. Atelectasis can also result from a traumatic chest injury, such as hitting the pavement at a high rate of speed.\r\n\r\nTo code atelectasis (J98.11), the physician needs to document atelectasis. Otherwise, we’ll report J98.19 (other pulmonary collapse).\r\n\r\nNext time you’re out cycling, keep a wary eye out for flatten alligators (and deer and skunks and raccoons). Never mind, I’ll take the bus.',
